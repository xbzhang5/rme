## Probabilitistic models

:::{#def-model}

### Models

**Scientific models** are attempts to describe *physical processes* that occur in the world and universe around us. 

:::

:::{#exm-model}

### Models in epidemiology

Epidemiologists typically study *biological processes*, such as the spread of infectious diseases through populations, or the effects of environmental factors on individuals.

:::

When we perform statistical analyses, we use data to help us choose between models - specifically, to determine which models best explain that data.

However, physical processes do not produce data on their own. Data is only produced when scientists implement an *observation process* (i.e., a *scientific study*), which is distinct from the underlying *physical process*^[in many cases, the observation process and the physical process interact with each other.].

In order to learn about the physical processes we are ultimately interested in, we often need to make special considerations for the observation process that produced the data which we are analyzing. In particular, if some of the planned observations in the study design were not completed, we will likely need to account for the incompleteness of the resulting data set in our analysis. If we are not sure why some observations are incomplete, we may need to model the observation process in addition to the physical process we were originally interested in. For example, if some participants in a study dropped out part-way through the study, we may need investigate why those participants dropped out, as opposed to other participants who completed the study.

These kinds of *missing data* issues are outside of the scope of this course; see @van2018flexible for more details.

## Estimands, estimates, and estimators

{{< include macros.qmd >}}

\index{estimand}

::: {#def-estimand}
### Estimand

An **estimand** is an unknown quantity whose value we want to know.^[c.f., @pohl2021estimands, @lawrance2020estimand]

::: {#exm-estimand}
### Mean height of students

If we are trying to determine the mean height of students at our school,
then the population mean is our estimand.
:::

In statistical contexts, most estimands are parameters of probabilistic
models, or functions of model parameters.

::: callout-note
### Notation for estimands

Model paramaters and other estimands are often symbolized using
lower-case Greek letters: $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$, etc.
:::

::: {#def-estimate}
### Estimate/estimated value

In statistics, an **estimate** or **estimated value** is an informed
guess of an estimand's value, based on observed data.

::: {#exm-estimate}
### Mean height of students

Suppose we measure the heights of 50 random students from our school,
and the sample mean was 175cm. We might use 175cm as an *estimate* of
the population mean.
:::
:::

\index{estimator}

::: {#def-estimator}
### Estimator

An **estimator** is a function $\hth(X_1,...X_n)$, whose input is a set
of random variables $X_1,...,X_n$, and whose corresponding observed
value $\hth(x_1,...x_n)$ is used as an estimate.
:::

::: callout-note
#### Notation for estimators

Estimators are often symbolized by placing a \^ ("hat") symbol on top of
the corresponding estimand; for example, $\hth$.
:::

::: {#exm-estimator}
### Mean height of students

If we want to estimate the mean height of students at our university,
which we will represent as $\mu$, we might measure the heights of
$n= 50$ randomly sampled students as random variables $X_1,...,X_n$.
Then we could use the function

$$\hat\mu(X_1,...,X_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \eqdef \bar X$$

as an *estimator* to produce an *estimate* $\hat\mu = \bar x$ of $\mu$.

Another estimator would be just the height of the first student sampled:

$$\hat\mu^{(2)}(X_1,...,X_n) = X_1$$

A third possible estimator would be the mean of all sampled students'
heights, except for the two most extreme; that is, if we re-order the
observations $X_{(1)} = \min_{i\in 1:n} X_i$,
$X_{(2)} = \min_{i\in \{1:n\} - \arg X_{(1)}} X_i$, ...,
$X_{(n)} = \max_{i\in 1:n} X_i$, then we could define the estimator:

$$\hat\mu^{(3)}(X_1,...,X_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=2}^{n-1} X_{(i)}$$

Which of these estimators is best? It depends on how we evaluate them
(see @sec-est-accuracy below).
:::

::: callout-note
### Contrasting estimands, estimates, and estimators

It's helpful to keep in mind the mathematical type of each estimation
concept:

-   estimands are numbers (or vector of numbers)
-   estimates are also numbers (or vectors)
-   estimators are functions of random variables, so they are also
    random variables
:::

## Accuracy of estimators {#sec-est-accuracy}

To determine which estimator is best, we need to define *best*.
"Accuracy" is usually most important; easy computation is usually
secondary.

::: {#def-accuracy}
### Accuracy

The **accuracy** of an estimator for a given estimand does not have a
consensus formal definition, but all of the usual candidates are related
to the distributions of the *errors* made by the resulting estimates.

::: {#def-error}
### Error

The **error** of an estimate $\hth$, often denoted $\e(\hth)$, is the
difference between the estimate and its estimand $\theta$; that is:

$$\e(\hth) \eqdef \hth - \th$$
:::

Some frequently-used measures of accuracy include:

::: {#def-mse}
### Mean squared error

The **mean squared error** of an estimator $\hth$, denoted
$\mselr{\hth}$, is the expectation of the square of the error[^1]:

$$\mselr{\hth} \eqdef \E{(\epsilon(\hth))^2}$$
:::

::: {#def-mae}
### Mean absolute error

The **mean absolute error** of an estimator is the expectation of the
absolute value of the error:

$$
\maelr{\hth} \eqdef \E{\abs{\epsilon(\hth)}}$$
:::

::: {#def-bias}
### Bias

The **bias** of an estimator $\hth$ for an estimand $\theta$ is the
expected value of the error:

$$\bias{\hth} \eqdef \E{\epsilon(\hth)}$$ {#eq-bias-def}
:::

::: {#thm-bias-exprs}
#### Expressions for bias

The following expressions are equivalent to the definition of bias:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bias{\hth} 
&\eqdef \E{\epsilon(\hth)}\\
&= \E{\hth - \theta}\\
&=\E{\hth} - \E{\theta}\\
&=\E{\hth} - \theta
\end{aligned}
$$

The third equality is by the linearity of expectation.

::: {#thm-mse-bias-variance}
#### MSE = Bias^2^ + Variance

For any one-dimensional estimator $\hth$:

$$\mselr{\hth} = \sqf{\bias{\hth}} + \var{\hth}$$

:::: proof
{{< include proof-mse-bias-variance.qmd >}}

#### Unbiased estimators

::: {#def-unbiased}
### unbiased estimator

An estimator $\hth$ is **unbiased** if $\bias{\hth} = 0$.
:::

::: {#thm-unbiased-props}
#### properties of unbiased estimators

If $\hth$ is unbiased, then:

$$\E{\hth} = \th$$ {#eq-unbiased-exp}
$$\mselr{\hth} = \var{\hth}$$ {#eq-unbiased-mse}

:::: proof

(@eq-unbiased-exp) If $\hth$ is unbiased, then:

$$
\ba
\bias{\hth} &= 0\\
\E{\hth} - \theta &= 0\\
\E{\hth} &= \theta
\ea
$$

(@eq-unbiased-mse) If $\hth$ is unbiased, then:

$$
\ba
\mselr{\hth} 
&= \E{\sqf{\e(\hth)}}\\
&= \E{\sqf{\hth - \th}}\\
&= \E{\sqf{\hth - \E{\hth}}}\\
&\eqdef \Var{\hth}
\ea
$$

(*Alternative proof of @eq-unbiased-mse*) We could have started from
@thm-mse-bias-variance instead:

$$
\ba
\mselr{\hth} 
&= \sqf{\bias{\hth}} + \var{\hth}\\
&= \sqf{0} + \var{\hth}\\
&= 0 + \var{\hth}\\
&= \var{\hth}\\
\ea
$$
