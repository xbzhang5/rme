# Building Cox Proportional Hazards models

## `hodg` Lymphoma Data Set from `KMsurv`

### Participants

43 bone marrow transplant patients at Ohio State University (Avalos
1993)

### Variables

-   `dtype`: Disease type (Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkins lymphoma)
-   `gtype`: Bone marrow graft type:
-   allogeneic: from HLA-matched sibling
-   autologous: from self (prior to chemo)
-   `time`: time to study exit
-   `delta`: study exit reason (death/relapse vs censored)
-   `wtime`: waiting time to transplant (in months)
-   `score`: Karnofsky score:
-   80--100: Able to carry on normal activity and to work; no special
    care needed.
-   50--70: Unable to work; able to live at home and care for most
    personal needs; varying amount of assistance needed.
-   10--60: Unable to care for self; requires equivalent of
    institutional or hospital care; disease may be progressing rapidly.

## Analysis plan

-   **survival function** for the four combinations of disease type and
    graft type.
-   **observed (nonparametric) vs. expected (semiparametric) survival**
    functions.
-   **complementary log-log survival** for the four groups.

## Cumulative hazard (log-scale) curves

Also known as "complementary log-log (clog-log) survival curves".

```{r}
#| label: fig-cloglog-na
#| fig-cap: "Complementary log-log survival curves - Nelson-Aalen estimates"

na_model = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ dtype + gtype,
  data = hodg2,
  type = "fleming")

na_model |> 
  survminer::ggsurvplot(
  legend = "bottom", 
  legend.title = "",
  ylab = "log(Cumulative Hazard)",
  xlab = "Time since transplant (days, log-scale)",
  fun = 'cloglog', 
  size = .5,
  ggtheme = theme_bw(),
  conf.int = FALSE, 
  censor = TRUE) |>  
  magrittr::extract2("plot") +
  guides(
    col = 
      guide_legend(
        ncol = 2,
        label.theme = 
          element_text(
            size = legend_text_size)))


```

Let's compare these empirical (i.e., non-parametric) curves with the
fitted curves from our `coxph()` model:

```{r}
#| label: fig-cloglog-ph
#| fig-cap: "Complementary log-log survival curves - PH estimates"

cox_model |> 
  survminer::ggsurvplot(
    facet_by = "",
    legend = "bottom", 
    legend.title = "",
    ylab = "log(Cumulative Hazard)",
    xlab = "Time since transplant (days, log-scale)",
    fun = 'cloglog', 
    size = .5,
    ggtheme = theme_bw(),
    censor = FALSE, # doesn't make sense for cox model
    conf.int = FALSE) |>  
  magrittr::extract2("plot") +
  guides(
    col = 
      guide_legend(
        ncol = 2,
        label.theme = 
          element_text(
            size = legend_text_size)))

```

Now let's overlay these cumulative hazard curves:

```{r}
#| label: fig-bmt-cumhaz
#| fig-cap: "Observed and expected cumulative hazard curves for `bmt` data (cloglog format)"

na_and_cph = 
  na_model |> 
  fortify(fun = "cumhaz") |> 
  # `fortify.survfit()` doesn't name cumhaz correctly:
  rename(cumhaz = surv) |>  
  mutate(
    surv = exp(-cumhaz),
    strata = trimws(strata)) |> 
  mutate(model = "Nelson-Aalen") |> 
  bind_rows(stack_surv_ph(cox_model))

na_and_cph |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = time, 
      y = cumhaz, 
      col = model)) +
  geom_step() +
  facet_wrap(~strata) +
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    name = "Cumulative hazard H(t) (log-scale)") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    name = "Survival time (t, days, log-scale)") +

```

# Predictions and Residuals

## Review: Predictions in Linear Regression

-   In linear regression, we have a linear predictor for each data point
    $i$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\eta_i &= \beta_0+\beta_1x_{1i}+\cdots+\beta_px_{pi}\\
\hat y_i &=\hat\eta_i = \hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_1x_{1i}+\cdots+\hat\beta_px_{pi}\\
y_i &\sim N(\eta_i,\sigma^2)
\end{aligned}
$$

-   $\hat y_i$ estimates the conditional mean of $y_i$ given the
    covariate values $\tilde x_i$. This together with the prediction
    error says that we are predicting the distribution of values of $y$.

## Review: Residuals in Linear Regression

-   The usual residual is $r_i=y_i-\hat y_i$, the difference between the
    actual value of $y$ and a prediction of its mean.
-   The residuals are also the quantities the sum of whose squares is
    being minimized by the least squares/MLE estimation.

## Predictions and Residuals in survival models

-   In survival analysis, the equivalent of $y_i$ is the event time
    $t_i$, which is unknown for the censored observations.
-   The expected event time can be tricky to calculate:

$$
\hat{\text{E}}[T|X=x] = \int_{t=0}^{\infty} \hat S(t)dt
$$

## Wide prediction intervals

The nature of time-to-event data results in very wide prediction
intervals:

-   Suppose a cancer patient is predicted to have a mean lifetime of 5
    years after diagnosis and suppose the distribution is exponential.
-   If we want a 95% interval for survival, the lower end is at the
    0.025 percentage point of the exponential which is
    `qexp(.025, rate = 1/5)` = `r qexp(.025, rate = 1/5)` years, or 1/40
    of the mean lifetime.
-   The upper end is at the 0.975 point which is
    `qexp(.975, rate = 1/5)` = `r qexp(.975, rate = 1/5)` years, or 3.7
    times the mean lifetime.
-   Saying that the survival time is somewhere between 6 weeks and 18
    years does not seem very useful, but it may be the best we can do.
-   For survival analysis, something is like a residual if it is small
    when the model is accurate or if the accumulation of them is in some
    way minimized by the estimation algorithm, but there is no exact
    equivalence to linear regression residuals.
-   And if there is, they are mostly quite large!

## Types of Residuals in Time-to-Event Models

-   It is often hard to make a decision from graph appearances, though
    the process can reveal much.
-   Some diagnostic tests are based on residuals as with other
    regression methods:
-   **Schoenfeld residuals** (via `cox.zph`) for proportionality.
-   **Cox-Snell residuals** for goodness of fit.
-   **martingale residuals** for non-linearity.
-   **dfbeta** for influence.

## Martingale and deviance residuals

For martingale and deviance residuals, the returned object is a vector
with one element for each subject (without collapse). Even censored
observations have a martingale residual and a deviance residual. Each
subject's value for the martingale residual and the deviance residual is
a single value.

## Score residuals

Each observation also has a score residual, though this is a vector, not
a scalar.

For score residuals the returned object is a matrix with one row per
subject and one column per variable. The row order will match the input
data for the original fit.

The score residuals are each individual's contribution to the score
vector: $\ell'(\beta;y_i)$

-   For Schoenfeld residuals, the returned object is a matrix with one
    row for each event and one column per variable.

-   The rows are ordered by time within strata, and an attribute
    **strata** is attached that contains the number of observations in
    each stratum.

-   The scaled Schoenfeld residuals are used in the `cox.zph()`
    function.

-   Only subjects with an observed event time have a Schoenfeld
    residual, which like the score residual is a vector.
:::

## Schoenfeld residuals

-   There is a Schoenfeld residual for each subject $i$ with an event
    (not censored) and for each predictor $x_{k}$.

-   At the event time $t$ for that subject, there is a risk set $R$, and
    each subject $j$ in the risk set has a risk coefficient $\theta_j$
    and also a value $x_{jk}$ of the predictor.

-   The Schoenfeld residual is the difference between $x_{ik}$ and the
    risk-weighted average of all the $x_{jk}$ over the risk set.

$$
r^S_{ik} = 
x_{ik}-\frac{\sum_{k\in R}x_{jk}\theta_k}{\sum_{k\in R}\theta_k}
$$

This residual measures how typical the individual subject is with
respect to the covariate at the time of the event. Since subjects should
fail more or less uniformly according to risk, the Schoenfeld residuals
should be approximately level over time, not increasing or decreasing.

We can test this with the correlation with time on some scale, which
could be the time itself, the log time, or the rank in the set of
failure times.

The default is to use the KM curve as a transform, which is similar to
the rank but deals better with censoring.

The `cox.zph()` function implements a score test proposed in  @grambsch1994proportional.

```{r}
hodg.zph = cox.zph(hodg.cox1)
print(hodg.zph)
```

### `gtype`

```{r}
ggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = "gtype")
```

### `dtype`

```{r}
ggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = "dtype")
```

### `score`

```{r}
ggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = "score")
```

### `wtime`

```{r}
ggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = "wtime")
```

### `gtype:dtype`

```{r}
ggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = "gtype:dtype")
```

### Conclusions

-   From the correlation test, the Karnofsky score and the interaction
    with graft type disease type induce modest but statistically
    significant non-proportionality.
-   The sample size here is relatively small (26 events in 43 subjects).
    If the sample size is large, very small amounts of
    non-proportionality can induce a significant result.
-   As time goes on, autologous grafts are over-represented at their own
    event times, but those from HOD patients become less represented.
-   Both the statistical tests and the plots are useful.

# Goodness of Fit using the Cox-Snell Residuals

(references: Klein & Moeschberger textbook, §11.2, and Dobson & Barnett
textbook, §10.6)

Suppose that an individual has a survival time $T$ which has survival
function $S(t)$, meaning that $\Pr(T> t) = S(t)$. Then $S(T)$ has a
uniform distribution on $(0,1)$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(S(T_i) \le u)
&= \Pr(T_i > S_i^{-1}(u))\\
&= S_i(S_i^{-1}(u))\\
&= u
\end{aligned}
$$

Also, if $U$ has a uniform distribution on $(0,1)$, then what is the
distribution of $-\ln(U)$?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(-\ln(U) < x) &= \Pr(U>\exp{-x})\\
&= 1-e^{-x} 
\end{aligned}
$$

which is the CDF of an exponential distribution with parameter
$\lambda=1$.

So,

$$
\begin{aligned}
r^{CS}_i&
\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}-\ln[\hat S(t_i|x_i)] 
= \hat H(t_i|\tilde x_i)
\end{aligned}
$$

should have an exponential distribution with constant hazard $\lambda=1$
if the estimate $\hat S_i$ is accurate, which means that these values
should look like a censored sample from this exponential distribution.
These values are called **generalized residuals** or **Cox-Snell
residuals**.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative Hazard of Cox-Snell Residuals"

hodg2 = hodg2 |> 
  mutate(cs = predict(hodg.cox1, type = "expected"))

surv.csr = survfit(
  data = hodg2,
  formula = Surv(time = cs, event = delta == "dead") ~ 1,
  type = "fleming-harrington")

autoplot(surv.csr, fun = "cumhaz") + 
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1), col = "red") +
  theme_bw()


```

The line with slope 1 and intercept 0 fits the curve relatively well, so
we don't see lack of fit using this procedure.

# Martingale Residuals

The **martingale residuals** are a slight modification of the Cox-Snell
residuals. If the censoring indicator is $\delta_i$, then
$$r^M_i=\delta_i-r^{CS}_i$$ These residuals can be interpreted as an
estimate of the excess number of events seen in the data but not
predicted by the model. We will use these to examine the functional
forms of continuous covariates.

::: content-hidden
## Martingale

Originally, a martingale referred to a betting strategy where you bet
\$1 on the first play, then you double the bet if you lose and continue
until you win. This seems like a sure thing, because at the end of each
series when you finally win, you are up \$1. For example,
$-1-2-4-8+16=1$. But this assumes that you have infinite resources.
Really, you have a large probability of winning \$1, and a small
probability of losing everything you have, kind of the opposite of a
lottery.

martingale

:   In probability, a **martingale** is a sequence of random variables
    such that the expected value of the next event at any time is the
    present observed value, and that no better predictor can be derived
    even with all past values of the series available. At least to a
    close approximation, the stock market is a martingale. Under the
    assumptions of the proportional hazards model, the martingale
    residuals ordered in time form a martingale.
:::

## Using Martingale Residuals

Martingale residuals can be used to examine the functional form of a
numeric variable.

-   We fit the model without that variable and compute the martingale
    residuals.
-   We then plot these martingale residuals against the values of the
    variable.
-   We can see curvature, or a possible suggestion that the variable can
    be discretized.

Let's use this to examine the `score` and `wtime` variables in the
`wtime` data set.

### Karnofsky score {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Martingale Residuals vs. Karnofsky Score"

hodg2 = hodg2 |> 
  mutate(
    mres = 
      hodg.cox1 |> 
      update(. ~ . - score) |> 
      residuals(type="martingale"))

hodg2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = score, y = mres)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", aes(col = "loess")) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(col = "lm")) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Karnofsky Score") +
  ylab("Martingale Residuals") +
  guides(col=guide_legend(title = ""))

```

The line is almost straight. It could be some modest transformation of
the Karnofsky score would help, but it might not make much difference.

### Waiting time {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Martingale Residuals vs. Waiting Time"

hodg2$mres = 
  hodg.cox1 |> 
  update(. ~ . - wtime) |> 
  residuals(type="martingale")

hodg2 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = wtime, y = mres)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", aes(col = "loess")) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(col = "lm")) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Waiting Time") +
  ylab("Martingale Residuals") +
  guides(col=guide_legend(title = ""))

```

The line could suggest a step function. To see where the drop is, we can
look at the largest waiting times and the associated martingale
residual.

The martingale residuals are all negative for `wtime` \>83 and positive
for the next smallest value. A reasonable cut-point is 80 days.

### Updating the model {.unnumbered}

Let's reformulate the model with dichotomized `wtime`.

```{r}
hodg2 = 
  hodg2 |> 
  mutate(
    wt2 = cut(
      wtime,c(0, 80, 200),
      labels=c("short","long")))

hodg.cox2 =
  coxph(
    formula = 
      Surv(time, event = delta == "dead") ~ 
      gtype*dtype + score + wt2,
    data = hodg2)
```

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Model summary table with waiting time on continuous scale"
hodg.cox1 |> drop1(test="Chisq")
```

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Model summary table with dichotomized waiting time"
hodg.cox2 |> drop1(test="Chisq")
```

The new model has better (lower) AIC.

# Checking for Outliers and Influential Observations

We will check for outliers using the deviance residuals. The martingale
residuals show excess events or the opposite, but highly skewed, with
the maximum possible value being 1, but the smallest value can be very
large negative. Martingale residuals can detect unexpectedly long-lived
patients, but patients who die unexpectedly early show up only in the
deviance residual. Influence will be examined using dfbeta in a similar
way to linear regression, logistic regression, or Poisson regression.

## Deviance Residuals

Roughly centered on 0 with approximate standard deviation 1.

## 

```{r}
hodg.mart = residuals(hodg.cox2,type="martingale")
hodg.dev = residuals(hodg.cox2,type="deviance")
hodg.dfb = residuals(hodg.cox2,type="dfbeta")
hodg.preds = predict(hodg.cox2)                   #linear predictor

```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Martingale Residuals vs. Linear Predictor"
plot(hodg.preds,
     hodg.mart,
     xlab="Linear Predictor",
     ylab="Martingale Residual")

```

The smallest three martingale residuals in order are observations 1, 29,
and 18.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Deviance Residuals vs. Linear Predictor"
plot(hodg.preds,hodg.dev,xlab="Linear Predictor",ylab="Deviance Residual")

```

The two largest deviance residuals are observations 1 and 29. Worth
examining.

## dfbeta

-   dfbeta is the approximate change in the coefficient vector if that
    observation were dropped

-   dfbetas is the approximate change in the coefficients, scaled by the
    standard error for the coefficients.

### Graft type

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "dfbeta Values by Observation Order for Graft Type"
plot(hodg.dfb[,1],xlab="Observation Order",ylab="dfbeta for Graft Type")

```

The smallest dfbeta for graft type is observation 1.

### Disease type

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "dfbeta Values by Observation Order for Disease Type"
plot(hodg.dfb[,2],
     xlab="Observation Order",
     ylab="dfbeta for Disease Type")

```

The smallest two dfbeta values for disease type are observations 1 and
16.

### Karnofsky score

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "dfbeta Values by Observation Order for Karnofsky Score"
plot(hodg.dfb[,3],
     xlab="Observation Order",
     ylab="dfbeta for Karnofsky Score")


```

The two highest dfbeta values for score are observations 1 and 18. The
next three are observations 17, 29, and 19. The smallest value is
observation 2.

### Waiting time (dichotomized)

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "dfbeta Values by Observation Order for Waiting Time (dichotomized)"
plot(
  hodg.dfb[,4],
  xlab="Observation Order",
  ylab="dfbeta for `Waiting Time < 80`")


```

The two large values of dfbeta for dichotomized waiting time are
observations 15 and 16. This may have to do with the discretization of
waiting time.

### Interaction: graft type and disease type

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "dfbeta Values by Observation Order for dtype:gtype"
plot(hodg.dfb[,5],
     xlab="Observation Order",
     ylab="dfbeta for dtype:gtype")

```

The two largest values are observations 1 and 16. The smallest value is observation 35.


| Diagnostic                 | Observations to Examine |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Martingale Residuals       | 1, 29, 18               |

| Graft by Disease Influence | 1, 16, 35               |

: Observations to Examine by Residuals and Influence {#tbl-obs-to-examine}

The most important observations to examine seem to be 1, 15, 16, 18, and
29.

## 

```{r}
with(hodg,summary(time[delta==1]))
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

  select(gtype, dtype, time, delta, score, wtime) |> 
  mutate(
    comment = 
      c(
        "early death, good score, low risk",
        "high risk grp, long wait, poor score",
        "high risk grp, short wait, poor score",
        "early death, good score, med risk grp",
        "early death, good score, med risk grp"
      ))
```

## Action Items

-   Unusual points may need checking, particularly if the data are not
    completely cleaned. In this case, observations 15 and 16 may show
    some trouble with the dichotomization of waiting time, but it still
    may be useful.
-   The two largest residuals seem to be due to unexpectedly early
    deaths, but unfortunately this can occur.
-   If hazards don't look proportional, then we may need to use strata,
    between which the base hazards are permitted to be different. For
    this problem, the natural strata are the two diseases, because they
    could need to be managed differently anyway.
-   A main point that we want to be sure of is the relative risk
    difference by disease type and graft type.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "Linear Risk Predictors for Lymphoma"
hodg.cox2 |> 
  predict(
    reference = "zero",
    newdata = means |> 
      mutate(
        wt2 = "short", 
        score = 0), 
    type = "lp") |> 
  data.frame('linear predictor' = _) |> 
  pander()

```

For Non-Hodgkin's, the allogenic graft is better. For Hodgkin's, the
autologous graft is much better.

# Stratified survival models

## Revisiting the leukemia dataset (`anderson`)

We will analyze remission survival times on 42 leukemia patients, half
on new treatment, half on standard treatment.

This is the same data as the `drug6mp` data from `KMsurv`, but with two
other variables and without the pairing. This version comes from the
Kleinbaum and Klein survival textbook (e.g., p281):


```{r,include = FALSE}
anderson = 
  fs::path_package(
    "rme", "extdata/anderson.dta") |> 
  haven::read_dta() |> 
  mutate(
    status = status |> 
      case_match(
        1 ~ "relapse",
        0 ~ "censored"
      ),
    
    sex = sex |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "female",
        1 ~ "male"
      ) |> 
      factor() |> 
      relevel(ref = "female"),
    
    rx = rx |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "new",
        1 ~ "standard"
      ) |> 
      factor() |> relevel(ref = "standard"),
    
    surv = Surv(
      time = survt, 
      event = (status == "relapse"))
  )

print(anderson)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}

anderson = 
  paste0(
    "http://web1.sph.emory.edu/dkleinb/allDatasets/",
    "surv2datasets/anderson.dta") |> 
  haven::read_dta() |> 
  mutate(
    status = status |> 
      case_match(
        1 ~ "relapse",
        0 ~ "censored"
      ),
    
    sex = sex |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "female",
        1 ~ "male"
      ) |> 
      factor() |> 
      relevel(ref = "female"),
    
    rx = rx |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "new",
        1 ~ "standard"
      ) |> 
      factor() |> relevel(ref = "standard"),
    
    surv = Surv(
      time = survt, 
      event = (status == "relapse"))
  )

print(anderson)
```

## Cox semi-parametric proportional hazards model

```{r}

anderson.cox1 = coxph(
  formula = surv ~ rx + sex + logwbc,
  data = anderson)

summary(anderson.cox1)

```

### Test the proportional hazards assumption

```{r}
cox.zph(anderson.cox1)
```

### Graph the K-M survival curves

```{r}

anderson_km_model = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ sex,
  data = anderson)

anderson_km_model |> 
  autoplot(conf.int = FALSE) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

The survival curves cross, which indicates a problem in the
proportionality assumption by sex.

## Graph the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard

We can also look at the log-hazard ("cloglog survival") plots:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative hazard (cloglog scale) for `anderson` data"
anderson_na_model = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ sex,
  data = anderson,
  type = "fleming")

anderson_na_model |> 
  autoplot(
    fun = "cumhaz",
    conf.int = FALSE) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  ylab("log(Cumulative Hazard)") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    trans = "log10",
    name = "Cumulative hazard (H(t), log scale)") +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(1,2,5,10,20,50),
    trans = "log"
  )

```

This can be fixed by using strata or possibly by other model
alterations.

## The Stratified Cox Model

-   In a stratified Cox model, each stratum, defined by one or more
    factors, has its own base survival function $h_0(t)$.
-   But the coefficients for each variable not used in the strata
    definitions are assumed to be the same across strata.
-   To check if this assumption is reasonable one can include
    interactions with strata and see if they are significant (this may
    generate a warning and NA lines but these can be ignored).
-   Since the `sex` variable shows possible non-proportionality, we try
    stratifying on `sex`.

```{r}

anderson.coxph.strat = 
  coxph(
    formula = 
      surv ~ rx + logwbc + strata(sex),
    data = anderson)

summary(anderson.coxph.strat)
```

Let's compare this to a model fit only on the subset of males:

```{r}

anderson.coxph.male = 
  coxph(
    formula = surv ~ rx + logwbc,
    subset = sex == "male",
    data = anderson)

summary(anderson.coxph.male)

```

```{r}
anderson.coxph.female = 
  coxph(
    formula = 
      surv ~ rx + logwbc,
    subset = sex == "female",
    data = anderson)

summary(anderson.coxph.female)
```

The coefficients of treatment look different. Are they statistically
different?

```{r}

anderson.coxph.strat.intxn = 
  coxph(
    formula = surv ~ strata(sex) * (rx + logwbc),
    data = anderson)

anderson.coxph.strat.intxn |> summary()

```

```{r}
anova(
  anderson.coxph.strat.intxn,
  anderson.coxph.strat)
```

We don't have enough evidence to tell the difference between these two
models.

## Conclusions

-   We chose to use a stratified model because of the apparent
    non-proportionality of the hazard for the sex variable.
-   When we fit interactions with the strata variable, we did not get an
    improved model (via the likelihood ratio test).
-   So we use the stratifed model with coefficients that are the same
    across strata.

## Another Modeling Approach

-   We used an additive model without interactions and saw that we might
    need to stratify by sex.
-   Instead, we could try to improve the model's functional form - maybe
    the interaction of treatment and sex is real, and after fitting that
    we might not need separate hazard functions.
-   Either approach may work.

```{r}

anderson.coxph.intxn = 
  coxph(
    formula = surv ~ (rx + logwbc) * sex,
    data = anderson)

anderson.coxph.intxn |> summary()
```

# Time-varying covariates

(adapted from Klein and Moeschberger 2003, §9.2:
https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b97377)

## Motivating example: back to the leukemia dataset

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
# load the data:
data(bmt, package = 'KMsurv')
bmt |> as_tibble() |> print(n = 5)
```

This dataset comes from the Copelan et al. (1991) study of allogenic
bone marrow transplant therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

#### Outcomes (endpoints)

-   The main endpoint is disease-free survival (`t2` and `d3`) for the
    three risk groups, "ALL", "AML Low Risk", and "AML High Risk".

#### Possible intermediate events

-   graft vs. host disease (**GVHD**), an immunological rejection
    response to the transplant (bad)
-   acute (**AGVHD**)
-   chronic (**CGVHD**)
-   platelet recovery, a return of platelet count to normal levels
    (good)

One or the other, both in either order, or neither may occur.

#### Covariates

-   We are interested in possibly using the covariates `z1`-`z10` to
    adjust for other factors.

-   In addition, the time-varying covariates for acute GVHD, chronic
    GVHD, and platelet recovery may be useful.

### Preprocessing

We add reformat the data before analysis:

```{r}
# reformat the data:
bmt1 = 
  bmt |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    id = 1:n(), # will be used to connect multiple records for the same individual
    
    group =  group |> 
      case_match(
        1 ~ "ALL",
        2 ~ "Low Risk AML",
        3 ~ "High Risk AML") |> 
      factor(levels = c("ALL", "Low Risk AML", "High Risk AML")),
    
    `patient age` = z1,
    
    `donor age` = z2,
    
    `patient sex` = z3 |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "Female",
        1 ~ "Male"),
    
    `donor sex` = z4 |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "Female",
        1 ~ "Male"),
    
    `Patient CMV Status` = z5 |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "CMV Negative",
        1 ~ "CMV Positive"),
    
    `Donor CMV Status` = z6 |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "CMV Negative",
        1 ~ "CMV Positive"),
    
    `Waiting Time to Transplant` = z7,
    
    FAB = z8 |> 
      case_match(
        1 ~ "Grade 4 Or 5 (AML only)",
        0 ~ "Other") |> 
      factor() |> 
      relevel(ref = "Other"),
    
    hospital = z9 |>  # `z9` is hospital
      case_match(
        1 ~ "Ohio State University",
        2 ~ "Alferd",
        3 ~ "St. Vincent",
        4 ~ "Hahnemann") |> 
      factor() |> 
      relevel(ref = "Ohio State University"),
    
    MTX = (z10 == 1) # a prophylatic treatment for GVHD
    
  ) |> 
  select(-(z1:z10)) # don't need these anymore

bmt1 |> 
  select(group, id:MTX) |> 
  print(n = 10)
```

results of adding or removing variables.

## Time-Dependent Covariates

-   A **time-dependent covariate** ("**TDC**") is a covariate whose
    value changes during the course of the study.
-   For variables like age that change in a linear manner with time, we
    can just use the value at the start.
-   But it may be plausible that when and if GVHD occurs, the risk of
    relapse or death increases, and when and if platelet recovery
    occurs, the risk decreases.

## Analysis in R

-   We form a variable `precovery` which is = 0 before platelet recovery
    and is = 1 after platelet recovery, if it occurs.
-   For each subject where platelet recovery occurs, we set up multiple
    records (lines in the data frame); for example one from t = 0 to the
    time of platelet recovery, and one from that time to relapse,
    recovery, or death.
-   We do the same for acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.
-   For each record, the covariates are constant.

```{r}

bmt2 = bmt1 |> 
  #set up new long-format data set:
  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, tstop = t2) |> 
  
  # the following three steps can be in any order, 
  # and will still produce the same result:
  #add aghvd as tdc:
  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, agvhd = tdc(ta)) |> 
  #add cghvd as tdc:
  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, cgvhd = tdc(tc)) |> 
  #add platelet recovery as tdc:
  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, precovery = tdc(tp))   

bmt2 = bmt2 |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(status = as.numeric((tstop == t2) & d3))
# status only = 1 if at end of t2 and not censored

```

Let's see how we've rearranged the first row of the data:

```{r}

bmt1 |> 
  dplyr::filter(id == 1) |> 
  dplyr::select(id, t1, d1, t2, d2, d3, ta, da, tc, dc, tp, dp)
```

The event times for this individual are:

-   `t` = 0 time of transplant
-   `tp` = 13 platelet recovery
-   `ta` = 67 acute GVHD onset
-   `tc` = 121 chronic GVHD onset
-   `t2` = 2081 end of study, patient not relapsed or dead

After converting the data to long-format, we have:

```{r}
bmt2 |> 
  select(
    id,
    tstart,
    tstop,
    agvhd,
    cgvhd,
    precovery,
    status
  ) |> 
  dplyr::filter(id == 1)
```

Note that `status` could have been `1` on the last row, indicating that
relapse or death occurred; since it is false, the participant must have
exited the study without experiencing relapse or death (i.e., they were
censored).

## Event sequences

Let:

-   A = acute GVHD
-   C = chronic GVHD
-   P = platelet recovery

Each of the eight possible combinations of A or not-A, with C or not-C,
with P or not-P occurs in this data set.

-   A always occurs before C, and P always occurs before C, if both
    occur.
-   Thus there are ten event sequences in the data set: None, A, C, P,
    AC, AP, PA, PC, APC, and PAC.
-   In general, there could be as many as $1+3+(3)(2)+6=16$ sequences,
    but our domain knowledge tells us that some are missing: CA, CP,
    CAP, CPA, PCA, PC, PAC
-   Different subjects could have 1, 2, 3, or 4 intervals, depending on
    which of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and/or platelet recovery
    occurred.
-   The final interval for any subject has `status` = 1 if the subject
    relapsed or died at that time; otherwise `status` = 0.
-   Any earlier intervals have `status` = 0.
-   Even though there might be multiple lines per ID in the dataset,
    there is never more than one event, so no alterations need be made
    in the estimation procedures or in the interpretation of the output.
-   The function `tmerge` in the `survival` package eases the process of
    constructing the new long-format dataset.

## Model with Time-Fixed Covariates

```{r}
bmt1 = 
  bmt1 |> 
  mutate(surv = Surv(t2,d3))

bmt_coxph_TF = coxph(
  formula = surv ~ group + `patient age`*`donor age` + FAB,
  data = bmt1)
summary(bmt_coxph_TF)
drop1(bmt_coxph_TF, test = "Chisq")
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Martingale residuals for `Donor age`"
bmt1$mres = 
  bmt_coxph_TF |> 
  update(. ~ . - `donor age`) |> 
  residuals(type="martingale")

bmt1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = `donor age`, y = mres)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", aes(col = "loess")) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(col = "lm")) +
  theme_classic() +
  xlab("Donor age") +
  ylab("Martingale Residuals") +
  guides(col=guide_legend(title = ""))
```

A more complex functional form for `donor age` seems warranted; left as
an exercise for the reader.

Now we will add the time-varying covariates:

```{r}

# add counting process formulation of Surv():
bmt2 = 
  bmt2 |> 
  mutate(
    surv = 
      Surv(
        time = tstart,
        time2 = tstop,
        event = status,
        type = "counting"))



```

## Model with Time-Dependent Covariates

```{r}
bmt_coxph_TV = coxph(
  formula = 
    surv ~ 
    group + `patient age`*`donor age` + FAB + agvhd + cgvhd + precovery,
  data = bmt2)

summary(bmt_coxph_TV)
```

Platelet recovery is highly significant.

Neither acute GVHD (`agvhd`) nor chronic GVHD (`cgvhd`) has a
statistically significant effect here, nor are they significant in
models with the other one removed.

```{r}

update(bmt_coxph_TV, .~.-agvhd) |> summary()
update(bmt_coxph_TV, .~.-cgvhd) |> summary()
```

Let's drop them both:

```{r}
bmt_coxph_TV2 = update(bmt_coxph_TV, . ~ . - agvhd -cgvhd)
bmt_coxph_TV2 |> summary()
```

# Recurrent Events

(Adapted from Kleinbaum and Klein, Ch 8)

-   Sometimes an appropriate analysis requires consideration of
    recurrent events.
-   A patient with arthritis may have more than one flareup. The same is
    true of many recurring-remitting diseases.
-   In this case, we have more than one line in the data frame, but each
    line may have an event.
-   We have to use a "robust" variance estimator to account for
    correlation of time-to-events within a patient.

## Bladder Cancer Data Set

The bladder cancer dataset from Kleinbaum and Klein contains recurrent
event outcome information for eighty-six cancer patients followed for
the recurrence of bladder cancer tumor after transurethral surgical
excision (Byar and Green 1980). The exposure of interest is the effect
of the drug treatment of thiotepa. Control variables are the initial
number and initial size of tumors. The data layout is suitable for a
counting processes approach.

This drug is still a possible choice for some patients. Another
therapeutic choice is Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a live bacterium
related to cow tuberculosis.

-   There are 85 patients and 190 lines in the dataset, meaning that
    many patients have more than one line.
-   Patient 1 with 0 observation time was removed.
-   Of the 85 patients, 47 had at least one recurrence and 38 had none.
-   18 patients had exactly one recurrence.
-   There were up to 4 recurrences in a patient.
-   Of the 190 intervals, 112 terminated with a recurrence and 78 were
    censored.

### Different intervals for the same patient are correlated.

-   Is the effective sample size 47 or 112? This might narrow confidence
    intervals by as much as a factor of $\sqrt{112/47}=1.54$

-   What happens if I have 5 treatment and 5 control values and want to
    do a t-test and I then duplicate the 10 values as if the sample size
    was 20? This falsely narrows confidence intervals by a factor of
    $\sqrt{2}=1.41$.

#| eval: false
bladder = 
  paste0(
    "http://web1.sph.emory.edu/dkleinb/allDatasets",
    "/surv2datasets/bladder.dta") |> 
  read_dta() |> 
  as_tibble()

bladder = bladder[-1,]  #remove subject with 0 observation time
print(bladder)
```

```{r}
#| include: false
bladder = 
  fs::path_package(
    "rme", "extdata/bladder.dta") |> 
  read_dta() |> 
  as_tibble()

bladder = bladder[-1,]  #remove subject with 0 observation time
print(bladder)
```

```{r}

bladder = 
  bladder |> 
  mutate(
    surv = 
      Surv(
        time = start,
        time2 = stop,
        event = event,
        type = "counting"))

bladder.cox1 = coxph(
  formula = surv~tx+num+size,
  data = bladder)

#results with biased variance-covariance matrix:
summary(bladder.cox1)

```

::: callout-note
The likelihood ratio and score tests assume independence of observations
within a cluster. The Wald and robust score tests do not.

### adding `cluster = id`

If we add `cluster= id` to the call to `coxph`, the coefficient
estimates don't change, but we get an additional column in the
`summary()` output: `robust se`:

```{r}

bladder.cox2 = coxph(
  formula = surv ~ tx + num + size,
  cluster = id,
  data = bladder)

#unbiased though this reduces power:
summary(bladder.cox2)

```

`robust se` is larger than `se`, and accounts for the repeated
observations from the same individuals:

```{r}
round(bladder.cox2$naive.var, 4)
round(bladder.cox2$var, 4)
```

These are the ratios of correct confidence intervals to naive ones:

```{r}
with(bladder.cox2, diag(var)/diag(naive.var)) |> sqrt()
```

We might try dropping the non-significant `size` variable:

```{r}
#remove non-significant size variable:
bladder.cox3 = bladder.cox2 |> update(. ~ . - size)
summary(bladder.cox3)
```
