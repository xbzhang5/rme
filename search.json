    "text": "This section is primarily adapted starting from the textbook “An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models” (4th edition, 2018) by Annette J. Dobson and Adrian G. Barnett:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1201/9781315182780\nThe type of predictive model one uses depends on several issues; one is the type of response.\n\nMeasured values such as quantity of a protein, age, weight usually can be handled in an ordinary linear regression model, possibly after a log transformation.\nPatient survival, which may be censored, calls for a different method (survival analysis, Cox regression).\nIf the response is binary, then can we use logistic regression models\nIf the response is a count, we can use Poisson regression\nIf the count has a higher variance than is consistent with the Poisson, we can use a negative binomial or over-dispersed Poisson\nOther forms of response can generate other types of generalized linear models\n\nWe need a linear predictor of the same form as in linear regression βx. In theory, such a linear predictor can generate any type of number as a prediction, positive, negative, or zero\nWe choose a suitable distribution for the type of data we are predicting (normal for any number, gamma for positive numbers, binomial for binary responses, Poisson for counts)\nWe create a link function which maps the mean of the distribution onto the set of all possible linear prediction results, which is the whole real line (-∞, ∞). The inverse of the link function takes the linear predictor to the actual prediction.\n\nOrdinary linear regression has identity link (no transformation by the link function) and uses the normal distribution\nIf one is predicting an inherently positive quantity, one may want to use the log link since ex is always positive.\nAn alternative to using a generalized linear model with a log link, is to transform the data using the log. This is a device that works well with measurement data and may be usable in other cases, but it cannot be used for 0/1 data or for count data that may be 0.\n\n\nR glm() Families\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily\nLinks\n\n\n\ngaussian\n\nidentity, log, inverse\n\n\nbinomial\n\nlogit, probit, cauchit, log, cloglog\n\n\ngamma\n\ninverse, identity, log\n\n\ninverse.gaussian\n\n1/mu^2, inverse, identity, log\n\n\nPoisson\n\nlog, identity, sqrt\n\n\nquasi\n\nidentity, logit, probit, cloglog, inverse, log, 1/mu^2 and sqrt\n\n\nquasibinomial\n\nlogit, probit, identity, cloglog, inverse, log, 1/mu^2 and sqrt\n\n\nquasipoisson\n\nlog, identity, logit, probit, cloglog, inverse, 1/mu^2 and sqrt\n\n\n\n\nR glm() Link Functions; \\(\\eta = X\\beta = g(\\mu)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nDomain\nRange\nLink Function\nInverse Link Function\n\n\n\nidentity\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\mu\\)\n\\(\\mu = \\eta\\)\n\n\nlog\n\\((0,\\infty)\\)\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\text{log}\\left\\{\\mu\\right\\}\\)\n\\(\\mu = \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta\\right\\}\\)\n\n\ninverse\n\\((0, \\infty)\\)\n\\((0,\\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = 1/\\mu\\)\n\\(\\mu = 1/\\eta\\)\n\n\nlogit\n\\((0,1)\\)\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\text{log}\\left\\{\\mu/(1-\\mu)\\right\\}\\)\n\\(\\mu = \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta\\right\\}/(1+\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta\\right\\})\\)\n\n\nprobit\n\\((0,1)\\)\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\Phi^{-1}(\\mu)\\)\n\\(\\mu = \\Phi(\\eta)\\)\n\n\ncloglog\n\\((0,1)\\)\n\\((-\\infty, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\text{log}\\left\\{-\\text{log}\\left\\{1-\\mu\\right\\}\\right\\}\\)\n\\(\\mu = {1-\\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta\\right\\}\\right\\}}\\)\n\n\n1/mu^2\n\\((0,\\infty)\\)\n\\((0, \\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = 1/\\mu^2\\)\n\\(\\mu = 1/\\sqrt{\\eta}\\)\n\n\nsqrt\n\\((0,\\infty)\\)\n\\((0,\\infty)\\)\n\\(\\eta = \\sqrt{\\mu}\\)\n\\(\\mu = \\eta^2\\)",

The choice of a reference level is arbitrary and does not limit what we can do with the resulting model; it only makes it more computationally convenient to make inferences about comparisons involving that reference group.\n\n\nNow, consider the following model:\n\\[Y \\sim N(\\mu(X_1,X_2), \\sigma^2)\\]\n\\[\\mu(X_1,X_2)\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}E[Y|X_1, X_2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1+ \\beta_2 X_2\\]\nImplementing the Model in R\nHere’s how we can implement this model in R:\n\nShow R codebw_lm1 = lm(\n  formula = weight ~ sex + age, \n  data = bw)\n\nbw_lm1 |&gt; \n  parameters(show_sigma = TRUE) |&gt; \n  print_md()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCoefficient\nSE\n95% CI\nt(21)\np\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-1773.32\n794.59\n(-3425.75, -120.89)\n-2.23\n0.037\n\n\nsex (male)\n163.04\n72.81\n(11.63, 314.45)\n2.24\n0.036\n\n\nage\n120.89\n20.46\n(78.34, 163.45)\n5.91\n&lt; .001\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how this model looks, superimposed on the data:\n\nShow R codebw = \n  bw |&gt; \n  mutate(`E[Y|X=x]` = fitted(bw_lm1)) |&gt; \n  arrange(sex, age)\n\nplot2 = \n  plot1 %+% bw +\n  geom_line(aes(y = `E[Y|X=x]`))\n\n\n\nShow R codeggplotly(plot2)\n\n\nParallel-slopes model of birthweight\n\n\nModel assumptions and predictions\nTo learn what this model is assuming, let’s plug in a few values.\nAccording to this model, what’s the mean birthweight for a female born at 36 weeks?\n\nShow R codepred_female = coef(bw_lm1)[\"(Intercept)\"] + coef(bw_lm1)[\"age\"]*36\n\n# print(pred_female)\n### built-in prediction: \n# predict(bw_lm1, newdata = tibble(sex = \"female\", age = 36))\n\n\n\\[E[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 0+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 =  2578.8739\\]\nWhat’s the mean birthweight for a male born at 36 weeks?\n\nShow R codepred_male = \n  coef(bw_lm1)[\"(Intercept)\"] + \n  coef(bw_lm1)[\"sexmale\"] + \n  coef(bw_lm1)[\"age\"]*36\n\n\n\\[\nE[Y|X_1 = 1, X_2 = 36] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 1+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 =  2741.9132\n\\]\nWhat’s the difference in mean birthweights between males born at 36 weeks and females born at 36 weeks?\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E[Y|X_1 = 1, X_2 = 36] - E[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36]\\\\\n&=\n2741.9132 - 2578.8739\\\\\n&=\n163.0393\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nShortcut:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E[Y|X_1 = 1, X_2 = 36] -\nE[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36]\\\\\n&= (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 1+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 0+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36) \\\\\n&= \\beta_1 \\\\\n&=  163.0393\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that age doesn’t show up in this difference: in other words, according to this model, the difference between females and males with the same gestational age is the same for every age.\nThat’s an assumption of the model; it’s built-in to the parametric structure, even before we plug in the estimated values of those parameters.\nThat’s why the lines are parallel.\n\n2.1.3 Interactions\nWhat if we don’t like that parallel lines assumption?\nThen we need to allow an “interaction” between age and sex:\n\\[\nE[Y|X_1, X_2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1+ \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 (X_1 \\cdot X_2)\n\\]\n\nShow R codebw_lm2 = lm(weight ~ sex + age + sex:age, data = bw)\n\n\nHere are the estimated parameters (\\(\\beta\\)s):\n\nShow R codebw_lm2 |&gt; \n  parameters() |&gt; \n  print_md()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCoefficient\nSE\n95% CI\nt(20)\np\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n-2141.67\n1163.60\n(-4568.90, 285.56)\n-1.84\n0.081\n\n\nsex (male)\n872.99\n1611.33\n(-2488.18, 4234.17)\n0.54\n0.594\n\n\nage\n130.40\n30.00\n(67.82, 192.98)\n4.35\n&lt; .001\n\n\nsex (male) × age\n-18.42\n41.76\n(-105.52, 68.68)\n-0.44\n0.664\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s another way we could rewrite this model (by collecting terms involving \\(X_2\\)):\n\\[\nE[Y|X_1, X_2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1+ (\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 X_1) X_2\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you want to understand a coefficient in a model with interactions, collect terms for the corresponding variable, and you will see what other variables are interacting with the variable you are interested in.\n\n\nIn this case, the coefficient \\(X_2\\) is interacting with \\(X_1\\). So the slope of \\(Y\\) with respect to \\(X_2\\) depends on the value of \\(X_2\\).\nAccording to this model, there is no such thing as “the slope of birthweight with respect to age”. There are two slopes, one for each sex.1 We can only talk about “the slope of birthweight with respect to age among males” and “the slope of birthweight with respect to age among females”.\nThen: that coefficient is the difference in means per unit change in its corresponding coefficient, when the other collected variables are set to 0.\nHere’s how this model looks, superimposed on the data:\n\nShow R codebw = \n  bw |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    predlm2 = predict(bw_lm2)\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(sex, age)\n\nplot1_interact = \n  plot1 %+% bw +\n  geom_line(aes(y = predlm2))\n\n\n\nShow R codeggplotly(plot1_interact)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can see that the lines aren’t parallel.\nTo learn what this model is assuming, let’s plug in a few values.\nAccording to this model, what’s the mean birthweight for a female born at 36 weeks?\n\nShow R codepred_female = coef(bw_lm2)[\"(Intercept)\"] + coef(bw_lm2)[\"age\"]*36\n\n\n\\[E[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 0+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 + \\beta_3 \\cdot (0 * 36) =  2552.7333\\] What’s the mean birthweight for a male born at 36 weeks?\n\nShow R codepred_male = \n  coef(bw_lm2)[\"(Intercept)\"] + \n  coef(bw_lm2)[\"sexmale\"] + \n  coef(bw_lm2)[\"age\"]*36 + \n  coef(bw_lm2)[\"sexmale:age\"] * 36\n\n\n\\[E[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 1+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 + \\beta_3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 36 =  2762.7069\\]\nWhat’s the difference in mean birthweights between males born at 36 weeks and females born at 36 weeks?\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& E[Y|X_1 = 1, X_2 = 36] - E[Y|X_1 = 0, X_2 = 36]\\\\\n&= (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 1+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 + \\beta_3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 36)\\\\\n&\\ \\ \\ \\ \\  -(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot 0+ \\beta_2 \\cdot 36 + \\beta_3 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 36) \\\\\n&= \\beta_2 + \\beta_3\\cdot 36\\\\\n&=  209.9736\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNote that age now does show up in the difference: in other words, according to this model, the difference in mean birthweights between females and males with the same gestational age can vary by gestational age.\nThat’s how the lines in the graph ended up non-parallel.\n\n2.1.4 Stratified regression\nWe could re-write the interaction model as a stratified model, with a slope and intercept for each sex:\n\nShow R codebw_lm_strat = \n  bw |&gt; \n  lm(\n    formula = weight ~ sex + sex:age - 1, \n    data = _)\n\nbw_lm_strat |&gt; \n  parameters() |&gt; \n  print_md()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nCoefficient\nSE\n95% CI\nt(20)\np\n\n\n\nsex (female)\n-2141.67\n1163.60\n(-4568.90, 285.56)\n-1.84\n0.081\n\n\nsex (male)\n-1268.67\n1114.64\n(-3593.77, 1056.42)\n-1.14\n0.268\n\n\nsex (female) × age\n130.40\n30.00\n(67.82, 192.98)\n4.35\n&lt; .001\n\n\nsex (male) × age\n111.98\n29.05\n(51.39, 172.57)\n3.86\n&lt; .001\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Curved-line regression\nIf we transform some of our covariates (\\(X\\)s) and plot the resulting model on the original covariate scale, we end up with curved regression lines:\n\nShow R codebw_lm3 = lm(weight ~ sex:log(age) - 1, data = bw)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\nggpenguins &lt;- \n  palmerpenguins::penguins |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(species == \"Adelie\") |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = bill_length_mm , y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  xlab(\"Bill length (mm)\") + \n  ylab(\"Body mass (g)\")\n\nggpenguins2 = ggpenguins +\n  stat_smooth(\n    method = \"lm\",\n              formula = y ~ log(x),\n              geom = \"smooth\") +\n  xlab(\"Bill length (mm)\") + \n  ylab(\"Body mass (g)\")\n\n\n\nShow R codeggpenguins2 |&gt;  ggplotly()",

print()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the model is correct, the blue line should stay flat and close to 0, and the cloud of dots should have the same vertical spread regardless of the fitted value.\nIf not, we probably need to change the functional form of linear component of the mean, \\[\\text{E}[Y|X=x] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + ... + \\beta_p X_p\\]\nScale-location plot\nWe can also plot the square roots of the absolute values of the standardized residuals against the fitted values:\n\nShow R codeautoplot(bw_lm2, which = 3, ncol = 1) |&gt; print()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the blue line doesn’t need to be near 0, but it should be flat. If not, the residual variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) might not be constant, and we might need to transform our outcome \\(Y\\) (or use a model that allows non-constant variance).\nResiduals versus leverage\nWe can also plot our standardized residuals against “leverage”, which roughly speaking is a measure of how unusual each \\(x_i\\) value is. Very unusual \\(x_i\\) values can have extreme effects on the model fit, so we might want ot remove those observations as outliers, particularly if they have large residuals.\n\nShow R codeautoplot(bw_lm2, which = 5, ncol = 1) |&gt; print()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blue line should be relatively flat and close to 0 here.\n\n2.7.5 Diagnostics constructed by hand\n\nShow R codebw = \n  bw |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    predlm2 = predict(bw_lm2),\n    residlm2 = weight - predlm2,\n    std_resid = residlm2 / sigma(bw_lm2),\n    # std_resid_builtin = rstandard(bw_lm2), # uses leverage\n    sqrt_abs_std_resid = std_resid |&gt; abs() |&gt; sqrt()\n    \n  )\n\n\nResiduals vs fitted\n\nShow R coderesid_vs_fit = bw |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = predlm2, y = residlm2, col = sex, shape = sex)\n  ) + \n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\nShow R codeprint(resid_vs_fit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized residuals vs fitted\n\nShow R codebw |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = predlm2, y = std_resid, col = sex, shape = sex)\n  ) + \n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized residuals vs gestational age\n\nShow R codebw |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = age, y = std_resid, col = sex, shape = sex)\n  ) + \n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsqrt(abs(rstandard())) vs fitted\nCompare with autoplot(bw_lm2, 3)\n\nShow R codebw |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = predlm2, y = sqrt_abs_std_resid, col = sex, shape = sex)\n  ) + \n  geom_point() +\n  theme_classic() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0)",

Examples of binary outcomes include:\n\nexposure (exposed vs unexposed)\ndisease (diseased vs healthy)\nrecovery (recovered vs unrecovered)\nrelapse (relapse vs remission)\nreturn to hospital (returned vs not)\nvital status (dead vs alive)\n\n\n\nLogistic regression uses the Bernoulli distribution to model the outcome variable, conditional on one or more covariates.\n\nExercise 3.2 Write down a mathematical definition of the Bernoulli distribution.\n\nSolution. See Definition A.8.\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Logistic regression versus linear regression\nLogistic regression differs from linear regression, which uses the Gaussian (“normal”) distribution to model the outcome variable, conditional on the covariates.\n\nExercise 3.3 Recall: what kinds of outcomes is linear regression used for?\n\nSolution. Linear regression is typically used for numerical outcomes that aren’t event counts or waiting times for an event. Examples of outcomes that are often analyzed using linear regression include include weight, height, and income.",

    "text": "3.2 Risk Estimation and Prediction\nIn Epi 203, you have already seen methods for modeling binary outcomes using one covariate that is also binary (such as exposure/non-exposure). In this section, we review one-covariate analyses, with a special focus on risk ratios and odds ratios, which are important concepts for interpreting logistic regression.\n\nExample 3.1 (Oral Contraceptive Use and Heart Attack)  \n\nResearch question: how does oral contraceptive (OC) use affect the risk of myocardial infarction (MI; a.k.a. heart attack)?\n\n\nThis was an issue when oral contraceptives were first developed, because the original formulations used higher concentrations of hormones. Modern OCs don’t have this issue.\n\nTable 3.1 contains simulated data for an imaginary follow-up (a.k.a. prospective) study in which two groups are identified, one using OCs and another not using OCs, and both groups are tracked for three years to determine how many in each groups have MIs.\n\n\nShow R code\nlibrary(dplyr)\noc_mi = \n  tribble(\n    ~OC, ~MI, ~Total,\n    \"OC use\", 13, 5000,\n    \"No OC use\", 7, 10000\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(`No MI` = Total - MI) |&gt; \n  relocate(`No MI`, .after = MI)\n\ntotals = \n  oc_mi |&gt; \n  summarize(across(c(MI, `No MI`, Total), sum)) |&gt; \n  mutate(OC = \"Total\")\n\noc_mi = bind_rows(oc_mi, totals)\n\npander(oc_mi)\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Simulated data from study of oral contraceptive use and heart attack risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOC\nMI\nNo MI\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nOC use\n13\n4987\n5000\n\n\nNo OC use\n7\n9993\n10000\n\n\nTotal\n20\n14980\n15000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3.4 Review: estimate the probabilities of MI for OC users and non-OC users in Example 3.1.\n\nSolution. \\[\\hat{p}(MI|OC) = \\frac{13}{5000} = 0.0026\\]\n\\[\\hat{p}(MI|\\neg OC) = \\frac{7}{10000} = 7\\times 10^{-4}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo meanings of “controls”\n\n\n\nDepending on context, “controls” can mean either individuals who don’t experience an exposure of interest, or individuals who don’t experience an outcome of interest.\n\nDefinition 3.1 (cases and controls in retrospective studies) In retrospective studies, participants who experience the outcome of interest are called cases, while participants who don’t experience that outcome are called controls.\n\n\nDefinition 3.2 (treatment groups and control groups in prospective studies) In prospective studies, the group of participants who experience the treatment or exposure of interest is called the treatment group, while the participants who receive the baseline or comparison treatment (for example, clinical trial participants who receive a placebo or a standard-of-care treatment rather than an experimental treatment) are called controls.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Comparing probabilities\n\nRisk differences\nThe simplest comparison of two probabilities, \\(\\pi_1\\), and \\(\\pi_2\\), is the difference of their values:\n\n\nDefinition 3.3 (Risk difference) The risk difference of two probabilities, \\(\\pi_1\\), and \\(\\pi_2\\), is the difference of their values: \\[\\delta(\\pi_1,\\pi_2) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\pi_1 - \\pi_2\\]\n\nExample 3.2 In Example 3.1, the estimated risk difference in MI risk between OC users and OC non-users is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat\\delta(\\pi(OC), \\pi(\\neg OC))\n&= \\delta(\\hat\\pi(OC), \\hat\\pi(\\neg OC))\\\\\n&= \\hat\\pi(OC) - \\hat\\pi(\\neg OC)\\\\\n&= 0.0026 - 7\\times 10^{-4}\\\\\n&= 0.0019\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nRisk ratios\n\n\nDefinition 3.4 (Relative risk ratios) The relative risk of probability \\(\\pi_1\\) compared to another probability \\(\\pi_2\\), also called the risk ratio, relative risk ratio, probability ratio, or rate ratio, is the ratio of those probabilities:\n\\[\\rho(\\pi_1,\\pi_2) = \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}\\]\n\nExample 3.3 Above, we estimated that: \\[\\hat{p}(MI|OC) = 0.0026\\]\n\\[\\hat{p}(MI|\\neg OC) = 7\\times 10^{-4}\\]\nSo we might estimate that the relative risk of MI for OC versus non-OC is:\n\n\nShow R code\nrr = (13/5000)/(7/10000)\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat\\rho(OC, \\neg OC)\n&=\\frac{\\hat{p}(MI|OC)}{\\hat{p}(MI|\\neg OC)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{0.0026}{7\\times 10^{-4}}\\\\\n&= 3.71428571\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe might summarize this result by saying that “the estimated probability of MI among OC users was 3.71428571 as high as the estimated probability among OC non-users.\n\n\nSometimes, we divide the risk difference by the comparison probability, or equivalently, subtract 1 from the risk ratio; the result is called the relative risk difference:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\xi(\\pi_1,\\pi_2)\n&= \\frac{\\pi_1-\\pi_2}{\\pi_2}\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2} - 1\n\\end{aligned}\\]\nRisk differences, risk ratios, and relative risk differences are defined by two probabilities, plus a choice of which probability is the baseline or reference probability (i.e., which probability is the subtrahend of the risk difference or the denominator of the risk ratio). To switch which one is the reference probability, invert the ratio and multiply the difference by -1.\n\nExample 3.4 Above, we estimated that the risk ratio of OC versus non-OC is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho(OC, \\neg OC)\n&= 3.71428571\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn comparison, the risk ratio for non-OC versus OC is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\rho(\\neg OC, OC)\n&=\\frac{\\hat{p}(MI|\\neg OC)}{\\hat{p}(MI|OC)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{7\\times 10^{-4}}{0.0026}\\\\\n&= 0.26923077\\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\rho(OC, \\neg OC)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Odds and probabilities\nIn logistic regression, we will make use of a transformation (rescaling) of probability, called odds.\n\nDefinition 3.5 (Odds) The odds of an outcome, denoted \\(\\omega\\) (“omega”), is the probability that the outcome occurs, divided by the probability that it doesn’t occur.\nThat is, if the probability of an outcome is \\(\\pi\\), then the corresponding odds of that outcome is\n\\[\\omega(\\pi) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\\]\nThis function, which transforms probabilities into odds, is called the odds function (see ?fig-odds-probs).\n\n\n\nShow R code\nodds = function(pi) pi/(1-pi)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nodds_plot = ggplot() + \n  geom_function(fun = odds, aes(col = \"odds function\")) +\n  xlim(0, .5) +\n  xlab(\"Probability\") +\n  ylab(\"Odds\") +\n  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = \"y=x\")) + \n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(colour = \"\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\nShow R code\nplotly::ggplotly(odds_plot) |&gt;  \n  plotly::layout(legend = list(orientation = 'h'))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 3.5 (Calculating odds) In Exercise 3.4, we estimated that the probability of MI, given OC use, is \\(\\pi(OC) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\Pr(MI|OC) = 0.0026\\). If this estimate is correct, then the odds of MI, given OC use, is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega(OC)\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac{\\Pr(MI|OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI|OC)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\Pr(MI|OC)}{1-\\Pr(MI|OC)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\pi(OC)}{1-\\pi(OC)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{0.0026}{1-0.0026}\\\\\n&=0.00260678\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 3.5 (Calculating odds) Estimate the odds of MI, for non-OC users.\n\nSolution. \\[\n\\omega_(\\neg OC) = 7.00490343\\times 10^{-4}\n\\]\n\n\n\nA shortcut for calculating odds\nThe usual estimate for a probability of an event is “# events/# observations”. We often denote # events as \\(x\\) and # observations as \\(n\\). So: \\[\\hat\\pi = \\frac{x}{n}\\] Thus, the usual estimate for the probability of a nonevent is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n1-\\hat\\pi\n&= 1-\\frac{x}{n}\\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n} - \\frac{x}{n}\\\\\n&= \\frac{n - x}{n}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, the estimated odds is: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\hat\\pi}{1-\\hat\\pi}\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{x}{n}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{n-x}{n}\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{x}{n-x}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] That is, odds can be calculated directly as “# events” divided by “# nonevents” (without needing to calculate \\(\\hat\\pi\\) and \\(1-\\hat\\pi\\) first).\n\nExample 3.6 (calculating odds using the shortcut) In Example 3.5, we calculated \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega(OC)\n&=0.00260678\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Let’s recalculate this result using our shortcut:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\omega(OC)\n&=\\frac{13}{5000-13}\\\\\n&=0.00260678\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSame answer!\n\n\n\nOdds of rare events\nFor rare events (small \\(\\pi\\)), odds and probabilities are nearly equal, because \\(1-\\pi \\approx 1\\) (see ?fig-odds-probs).\nFor example, in Example 3.5, the probability and odds differ by \\(6.77762182\\times 10^{-6}\\).\n\nExercise 3.6 What odds value corresponds to the probability \\(\\pi = 0.2\\), and what is the numerical difference between these two values?\n\nSolution. \\[\n\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{1-\\pi}\n=\\frac{.2}{.8}\n= .25\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 The inverse odds function\n\nDefinition 3.6 (inverse odds function) The inverse odds function, \\[\\pi(\\omega)\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac{\\omega}{1+\\omega}\\] converts odds into their corresponding probabilities (Figure 3.1).\n\nThe inverse-odds function takes an odds as input and produces a probability as output. Its domain of inputs is \\([0,\\infty)\\) and its range of outputs is \\([0,1]\\).\n\n\nShow R code\nodds_inv = function(omega) (1 + omega^-1)^-1\nggplot() +\n  geom_function(fun = odds_inv, aes(col = \"inverse-odds\")) +\n  xlab(\"Odds\") +\n  ylab(\"Probability\") +\n  xlim(0,5) +\n  ylim(0,1) +\n  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = \"x=y\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The inverse odds function, \\(\\pi(\\omega)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAn equivalent expression for the inverse odds function is \\[\\pi(\\omega) = (1-\\omega^{-1})^{-1} \\tag{3.1}\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 3.7 Prove that Equation 3.1 is equivalent to Definition 3.6.\n\n\nExercise 3.8 What probability corresponds to an odds of \\(\\omega = 1\\), and what is the numerical difference between these two values?\n\nSolution. \\[\n\\pi(1) = \\frac{1}{1+1}\n=\\frac{1}{2}\n= .5\n\\] \\[\n1 - \\pi(1) = 1 - .5 = .5\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Odds ratios\nNow that we have defined odds, we can introduce another way of comparing event probabilities: odds ratios.\n\nDefinition 3.7 (Odds ratio) The odds ratio for two odds \\(\\omega_1\\), \\(\\omega_2\\) is their ratio:\n\\[\\theta(\\omega_1, \\omega_2) = \\frac{\\omega_1}{\\omega_2}\\]\n\n\nExample 3.7 (Calculating odds ratios) In Example 3.1, the odds ratio for OC users versus OC-non-users is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta(\\omega(OC), \\omega(\\neg OC))\n&= \\frac{\\omega(OC)}{\\omega(\\neg OC)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{0.0026}{7\\times 10^{-4}}\\\\\n&= 3.71428571\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWhen the outcome is rare (i.e., its probability is small) for both groups being compared in an odds ratio, the odds of the outcome will be similar to the probability of the outcome, and thus the risk ratio will be similar to the odds ratio.\nFor example, in Example 3.1, the outcome is rare for both OC and non-OC participants, so the odds for both groups are similar to the corresponding probabilities, and the odds ratio is similar the risk ratio.\n\nA shortcut for calculating odds ratio estimates\nThe general form of a two-by-two table is shown in Table 3.2.\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: A generic 2x2 table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nNon-Event\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nExposed\na\nb\na+b\n\n\nNon-exposed\nc\nd\nc+d\n\n\nTotal\na+c\nb+d\na+b+c+d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this table, we have:\n\n\\(\\hat\\pi(Event|Exposed) = a/(a+b)\\)\n\\(\\hat\\pi(\\neg Event|Exposed) = b/(a+b)\\)\n\\(\\hat\\omega(Event|Exposed) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a}{a+b}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{b}{a+b}\\right)}=\\frac{a}{b}\\)\n\\(\\hat\\omega(Event|\\neg Exposed) = \\frac{c}{d}\\) (see Exercise 3.9)\n\\(\\theta(Exposed,\\neg Exposed) = \\frac{\\frac{a}{b}}{\\frac{c}{d}} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\\)\n\n\nExercise 3.9 Given Table 3.2, show that \\(\\hat\\omega(Event|\\neg Exposed) = \\frac{c}{d}\\).\n\n\n\nProperties of odds ratios\nOdds ratios have a special property: we can swap a covariate with the outcome, and the odds ratio remains the same.\n\nExample 3.8 In Example 3.1, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta(MI; OC)\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\n\\frac{\\omega(MI|OC)}{\\omega(MI|\\neg OC)}\\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac\n{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI|OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI|OC)}\\right)}\n{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI|\\neg OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI|\\neg OC)}\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\frac\n{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI,OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI,OC)}\\right)}\n{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI,\\neg OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI,\\neg OC)}\\right)}\\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI,OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI,OC)}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(\\neg MI,\\neg OC)}{\\Pr(MI,\\neg OC)}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(MI,OC)}{\\Pr(MI,\\neg OC)}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(\\neg MI,\\neg OC)}{\\Pr(\\neg MI,OC)}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(OC,MI)}{\\Pr(\\neg OC,MI)}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(\\neg OC,\\neg MI)}{\\Pr(OC,\\neg MI)}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\left(\\frac{\\Pr(OC|MI)}{\\Pr(\\neg OC|MI)}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(\\neg OC|\\neg MI)}{\\Pr(OC|\\neg MI)}\\right)\\\\\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(OC|MI)}{\\Pr(\\neg OC|MI)}\\right)}\n{\\left(\\frac{\\Pr(OC|\\neg MI)}{\\Pr(\\neg OC|\\neg MI)}\\right)}\\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\frac{\\omega(OC|MI)}\n{\\omega(OC|\\neg MI)}\\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\theta(OC; MI)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 3.10 For Table 3.2, show that \\(\\hat\\theta(Exposed, Unexposed) = \\hat\\theta(Event, \\neg Event)\\).\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Effect of study design\nTable 3.1 simulates a follow-up study in which two populations were followed and the number of MI’s was observed. The risks are \\(P(MI|OC)\\) and \\(P(MI|\\neg OC)\\) and we can estimate these risks from the data.\nBut suppose we had a case-control study in which we had 100 women with MI and selected a comparison group of 100 women without MI (matched as groups on age, etc.). Then MI is not random, and we cannot compute P(MI|OC) and we cannot compute the risk ratio. However, the odds ratio however can be computed.\nThe disease odds ratio is the odds for the disease in the exposed group divided by the odds for the disease in the unexposed group, and we cannot validly compute and use these separate parts.\nBut we can validly compute and use the exposure odds ratio, which is the odds for exposure in the disease group divided by the odds for exposure in the non-diseased group (because exposure can be treated as random):\n\\[\n\\hat\\theta(OC|MI) =\n\\frac{\\hat{\\omega}(OC|MI)}{\\hat{\\omega}(OC|\\neg MI)}\n\\]\nAnd these two odds ratios, \\(\\hat\\theta(MI|OC)\\) and \\(\\hat\\theta(OC|MI)\\) are mathematically equivalent, as we saw in Section 3.2.4.2.\n\nExercise 3.11 Calculate the odds ratio of MI with respect to OC use, assuming that Table 3.1 comes from a case-control study. Confirm that the result is the same as in Example 3.7.\n\nSolution. \n\n\\(\\omega(OC|MI) = P(OC|MI)/(1 – P(OC|MI) = \\frac{13}{7} = 1.85714286\\)\n\\(\\omega(OC|\\neg MI) = P(OC|\\neg MI)/(1 – P(OC|\\neg MI) = \\frac{4987}{9993} = 0.49904933\\)\n\\(\\theta(OC,MI) = \\frac{\\omega(OC|MI)}{\\omega(OC|\\neg MI)} = \\frac{13/7}{4987/9993} = 3.72136125\\)\n\nThis is the same estimate we calculated in Example 3.7.\n\n\n\nCross-Sectional Studies\n\nIf a cross-sectional study is a probability sample of a population (which it rarely is) then we can estimate risks.\nIf it is a sample, but not an unbiased probability sample, then we need to treat it in the same way as a case-control study.\nWe can validly estimate odds ratios in either case.\nBut we can usually not validly estimate risks and risk ratios.",

(2012):\n“The Western Collaborative Group Study (WCGS) was a large epidemiological study designed to investigate the association between the”type A” behavior pattern and coronary heart disease (CHD) (Rosenman et al. 1964).”\nFrom Wikipedia, “Type A and Type B personality theory”:\n“The hypothesis describes Type A individuals as outgoing, ambitious, rigidly organized, highly status-conscious, impatient, anxious, proactive, and concerned with time management….\nThe hypothesis describes Type B individuals as a contrast to those of Type A. Type B personalities, by definition, are noted to live at lower stress levels. They typically work steadily and may enjoy achievement, although they have a greater tendency to disregard physical or mental stress when they do not achieve.”\n\n\nStudy design\nfrom ?faraway::wcgs:\n3154 healthy young men aged 39-59 from the San Francisco area were assessed for their personality type. All were free from coronary heart disease at the start of the research. Eight and a half years later change in CHD status was recorded.\nDetails (from faraway::wcgs)\nThe WCGS began in 1960 with 3,524 male volunteers who were employed by 11 California companies. Subjects were 39 to 59 years old and free of heart disease as determined by electrocardiogram. After the initial screening, the study population dropped to 3,154 and the number of companies to 10 because of various exclusions. The cohort comprised both blue- and white-collar employees.\nAt baseline the following information was collected:\n\nsocio-demographic including:\nage\neducation\nmarital status\nincome\noccupation\nphysical and physiological including:\nheight\nweight\nblood pressure\nelectrocardiogram\ncorneal arcus;\nbiochemical including:\ncholesterol and lipoprotein fractions;\nmedical and family history and use of medications;\nbehavioral data including\nType A interview,\nsmoking,\nexercise\nalcohol use.\n\nLater surveys added data on:\n\nanthropometry\ntriglycerides\nJenkins Activity Survey\ncaffeine use\n\nAverage follow-up continued for 8.5 years with repeat examinations.\nReference: Coronary Heart Disease in the Western Collaborative Group Study Final Follow-up Experience of 8 1/2 Years Ray H.

We won’t go over it in this class; if you need to learn it, see Dobson and Barnett (2018), Chapter 4.\nFor now, all you need to know is that we make an iterative series of guesses, and each guess helps us make the next guess better (higher log-likelihood).\nYou can see some information about this process like so:\n\n\nShow R code\noptions(digits = 8)\ntemp = \n  wcgs |&gt; \n  glm(\n    control = glm.control(trace = TRUE),\n    \"data\" = _,\n    \"formula\" = chd69 == \"Yes\" ~ dibpat*age, \n    \"family\" = binomial(link = \"logit\")\n  )\n\n\nDeviance = 1775.7899 Iterations - 1\nDeviance = 1708.5396 Iterations - 2\nDeviance = 1704.0434 Iterations - 3\nDeviance = 1703.9833 Iterations - 4\nDeviance = 1703.9832 Iterations - 5\nDeviance = 1703.9832 Iterations - 6\n\n\nAfter each iteration of the fitting procedure, the deviance (\\(2(\\ell_{\\text{full}} - \\ell(\\hat\\beta))\\) ) is printed.

    "text": "3.6 Model comparisons for logistic models\n\n3.6.1 Deviance test\nWe can compare the maximized log-likelihood of our model, \\(\\ell(\\hat\\beta; \\mathbf x)\\), versus the log-likelihood of the full model (aka saturated model aka maximal model), \\(\\ell_{\\text{full}}\\), which has one parameter per covariate pattern. With enough data, \\(2(\\ell_{\\text{full}} - \\ell(\\hat\\beta; \\mathbf x)) \\dot \\sim \\chi^2(N - p)\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of distinct covariate patterns and \\(p\\) is the number of \\(\\beta\\) parameters in our model. A significant p-value for this deviance statistic indicates that there’s some detectable pattern in the data that our model isn’t flexible enough to catch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nThe deviance statistic needs to have a large amount of data for each covariate pattern for the \\(\\chi^2\\) approximation to hold. A guideline from Dobson is that if there are \\(q\\) distinct covariate patterns \\(x_1...,x_q\\), with \\(n_1,...,n_q\\) observations per pattern, then the expected frequencies \\(n_k \\cdot \\pi(x_k)\\) should be at least 1 for every pattern \\(k\\in 1:q\\).\n\n\nIf you have covariates measured on a continuous scale, you may not be able to use the deviance tests to assess goodness of fit.\n\n\n3.6.2 Hosmer-Lemeshow test\nIf our covariate patterns produce groups that are too small, a reasonable solution is to make bigger groups by merging some of the covariate-pattern groups together.\nHosmer and Lemeshow (1980) proposed that we group the patterns by their predicted probabilities according to the model of interest. For example, you could group all of the observations with predicted probabilities of 10% or less together, then group the observations with 11%-20% probability together, and so on; \\(g=10\\) categories in all.\nThen we can construct a statistic \\[X^2 = \\sum_{c=1}^g \\frac{(o_c - e_c)^2}{e_c}\\] where \\(o_c\\) is the number of events observed in group \\(c\\), and \\(e_c\\) is the number of events expected in group \\(c\\) (based on the sum of the fitted values \\(\\hat\\pi_i\\) for observations in group \\(c\\)).\nIf each group has enough observations in it, you can compare \\(X^2\\) to a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution; by simulation, the degrees of freedom has been found to be approximately \\(g-2\\).\nFor our CHD model, this procedure would be:\n\n\nShow R code\nwcgs = \n  wcgs |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    pred_probs_glm1 = chd_glm_strat |&gt; fitted(),\n    pred_prob_cats1 = \n      pred_probs_glm1 |&gt; \n      cut(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = .1), \n          include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nHL_table = \n  wcgs |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    .by = pred_prob_cats1,\n    n = n(),\n    o = sum(chd69 == \"Yes\"),\n    e = sum(pred_probs_glm1)\n  )\n\nHL_table |&gt; pander()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npred_prob_cats1\nn\no\ne\n\n\n\n\n(0.1,0.2]\n785\n116\n108\n\n\n(0.2,0.3]\n64\n12\n13.77\n\n\n[0,0.1]\n2305\n129\n135.2\n\n\n\n\n\nShow R code\nX2 = HL_table |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    `X^2` = sum((o-e)^2/e)\n  ) |&gt; \n  pull(`X^2`)\nprint(X2)\n\n\n[1] 1.1102871\n\n\nShow R code\npval1 = pchisq(X2, lower = FALSE, df = nrow(HL_table) - 2)\n\n\nOur statistic is \\(X^2 = 1.11028711\\); \\(p(\\chi^2(1) &gt; 1.11028711) = 0.29201955\\), which is our p-value for detecting a lack of goodness of fit.\nUnfortunately that grouping plan left us with just three categories with any observations, so instead of grouping by 10% increments of predicted probability, typically analysts use deciles of the predicted probabilities:\n\n\nShow R code\nwcgs = \n  wcgs |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    pred_probs_glm1 = chd_glm_strat |&gt; fitted(),\n    pred_prob_cats1 = \n      pred_probs_glm1 |&gt; \n      cut(breaks = quantile(pred_probs_glm1, seq(0, 1, by = .1)), \n          include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nHL_table = \n  wcgs |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    .by = pred_prob_cats1,\n    n = n(),\n    o = sum(chd69 == \"Yes\"),\n    e = sum(pred_probs_glm1)\n  )\n\nHL_table |&gt; pander()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npred_prob_cats1\nn\no\ne\n\n\n\n\n(0.114,0.147]\n275\n48\n36.81\n\n\n(0.147,0.222]\n314\n51\n57.19\n\n\n(0.0774,0.0942]\n371\n27\n32.56\n\n\n(0.0942,0.114]\n282\n30\n29.89\n\n\n(0.0633,0.069]\n237\n17\n15.97\n\n\n(0.069,0.0774]\n306\n20\n22.95\n\n\n(0.0487,0.0633]\n413\n27\n24.1\n\n\n(0.0409,0.0487]\n310\n14\n14.15\n\n\n[0.0322,0.0363]\n407\n16\n13.91\n\n\n(0.0363,0.0409]\n239\n7\n9.48\n\n\n\n\n\nShow R code\nX2 = HL_table |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    `X^2` = sum((o-e)^2/e)\n  ) |&gt; \n  pull(`X^2`)\n\nprint(X2)\n\n\n[1] 6.7811383\n\n\nShow R code\npval1 = pchisq(X2, lower = FALSE, df = nrow(HL_table) - 2)\n\n\nNow we have more evenly split categories.

However, there is an important difference: in count regression, there is no intercept corresponding to \\(\\mathbb E[Y|T=0]\\). In other words, this model assumes that if there is no exposure, there can’t be any events.\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Adding covariates\nWith covariates, \\(\\lambda\\) becomes a function of the covariates \\(\\tilde X = (X_1, \\dots,X_n)\\), with a \\(\\text{log}\\left\\{\\right\\}\\) link function (and thus an \\(\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\right\\}\\) inverse-link). That is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbb E[Y | \\tilde X = \\tilde x,T=t]\n&= \\mu(\\tilde x,t)\\\\\n\\mu(\\tilde x,t)\n&= \\lambda(\\tilde x)\\cdot t\\\\\n\\lambda(\\tilde x)\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(\\tilde x)\\right\\}\\\\\n\\eta(\\tilde x)\n&= \\tilde x'\\tilde \\beta = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_p x_p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nTherefore, \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{log}\\left\\{\\{\\mathbb E[Y | \\tilde X = \\tilde x,T=t] \\}\\right\\}\n&= \\text{log}\\left\\{\\{\\mu(\\tilde x)\\}\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\text{log}\\left\\{\\{\\lambda(\\tilde x) \\cdot t \\}\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\text{log}\\left\\{\\lambda(\\tilde x)\\right\\} + \\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\text{log}\\left\\{\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(\\tilde x)\\right\\}\\right\\} + \\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\eta(\\tilde x) + \\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\tilde x'\\tilde\\beta + \\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\\\\n&=(\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_1+\\dots + \\beta_p x_p) + \\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn contrast with the \\(X\\)s, \\(T\\) enters this expression with a \\(\\text{log}\\left\\{\\right\\}\\) transformation and without a corresponding \\(\\beta\\) coefficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTerms that enter the linear component of a model without a coefficient, such as \\(\\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\}\\) here, are called offsets.\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Rate ratios\nDifferences on the log-rate scale become ratios on the rate scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\\[\\text{exp}\\left\\{a-b\\right\\} = \\frac{\\text{exp}\\left\\{a\\right\\}}{\\text{exp}\\left\\{b\\right\\}}\\]\n\n\nTherefore, according to this model, differences of \\(\\delta\\) in covariate \\(x_j\\) correspond to rate ratios of \\(\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\beta_j \\cdot\\delta\\right\\}\\).\nThat is, letting \\(\\tilde X_{-j}\\) denote vector \\(\\tilde X\\) with element \\(j\\) removed:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&{\n\\left\\{\n    \\text{log}\\left\\{\\mathbb E[Y |{\\color{red}{X_j = a}}, \\tilde X_{-j}=\\tilde x_{-j},T=t]\\right\\}\n    \\atop\n    {-\\text{log}\\left\\{\\mathbb E[Y |{\\color{red}{X_j = b}}, \\tilde X_{-j}=\\tilde x_{-j},T=t]\\right\\}}\n    \\right\\}\n}\\\\\n&=\n{\\left\\{\n\\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\} + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... + {\\color{red}{\\beta_j (a)}} + ...+\\beta_p x_p\n\\atop\n{-\\text{log}\\left\\{t\\right\\} + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + ... + {\\color{red}{\\beta_j (b)}} + ...+\\beta_p x_p}\n\\right\\}}\\\\\n&= \\color{red}{\\beta_j(a-b)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAnd accordingly,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac\n{\\mathbb{E}[Y |{\\color{red}{X_j = a}}, \\tilde X_{-j} = \\tilde x_{-j}, T = t]\n}\n{\n\\mathbb E[Y |{\\color{red}{X_j = b}}, \\tilde X_{-j}=\\tilde x_{-j},T=t]\n}\n=\n\\text{exp}\\left\\{{\\color{red}{\\beta_j(a-b)}}\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]",

In practice, many count distributions will have a variance substantially larger than the mean (or occasionally smaller).\nWhen we encounter this, we can try to reduce the residual variance by adding more covariates. However, there are also alternatives to the Poisson model.\nMost notably, the negative binomial model:\n\\[P(Y=y) = \\frac{\\mu^y}{y!} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(\\rho + y)}{\\Gamma(\\rho) \\cdot (\\rho + \\mu)^y} \\cdot \\left(1+\\frac{\\mu}{\\rho}\\right)^{-\\rho}\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is an overdispersion parameter and \\(\\Gamma(x) = (x-1)!\\) for integers \\(x\\).\nYou don’t need to memorize or understand this expression, but as \\(\\rho \\rightarrow \\infty\\), the second term converges to 1 and the third term converges to \\(\\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\mu\\right\\}\\), which brings us back to the Poisson distribution.\nFor this distribution, \\(\\mathbb E[Y] = \\mu\\) and \\(\\text{Var}(Y) = \\mu + \\frac{\\mu^2}{\\rho} &gt; \\mu\\).\nWe can still model \\(\\mu\\) as a function of \\(X\\) and \\(T\\) as before, and we can combine this model with zero-inflation by using it in place of the Poisson distribution for \\(P(Y=y|Z=0,X=x,T=t)\\).\n\n4.6.2 Quasipoisson\nAn alternative to Negative binomial is the “quasipoisson” distribution. I’ve never used it, but it seems to be a method-of-moments type approach rather than maximum likelihood. It models the variance as \\(\\text{Var}(Y) = \\mu\\theta\\), and estimates \\(\\theta\\) accordingly.\nSee ?quasipoisson in R for more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDobson, Annette J, and Adrian G Barnett. 2018.

In other words, the range of \\(T\\) is typically \\([0,\\infty)\\).\n\nExample 5.1 (exponential distribution) Recall from Epi 202: the pdf of the exponential distribution family of models is:\n\\[p(T=t) = \\mathbb{1}_{t \\ge 0}\\cdot \\lambda  \\text{e}^{-\\lambda t}\\]\nwhere \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\).\nHere are some examples of exponential pdfs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\nThe cumulative distribution function is defined as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nF(t) &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\Pr(T \\le t)\\\\\n&=\\int_{u=0}^t f(u) du\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nExample 5.2 (exponential distribution) Recall from Epi 202: the cdf of the exponential distribution family of models is:\n\\[\nP(T\\le t) = \\mathbb{1}_{t \\ge 0}\\cdot(1- \\text{e}^{-\\lambda t})\n\\] where \\(\\lambda &gt; 0\\).\nHere are some examples of exponential cdfs:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 The Survival Function\nFor survival data, a more important quantity is the survival function:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(t) &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\Pr(T &gt; t)\\\\\n&=\\int_{u=t}^\\infty p(u) du\\\\\n&=1-F(t)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe survival function \\(S(t)\\) is the probability that the event time is later than \\(t\\).

    "text": "5.7 The Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator\n\nThe estimated survival function for the placebo patients is easy to compute. For any time \\(t\\) in months, \\(S(t)\\) is the fraction of patients with times greater than \\(t\\).\nFor the 6-MP patients, we cannot ignore the censored data because we know that the time to relapse is greater than the censoring time.\nFor any time \\(t\\) in months, we know that 6-MP patients with times greater than \\(t\\) have not relapsed, and those with relapse time less than \\(t\\) have relapsed, but we don’t know if patients with censored time less than \\(t\\) have relapsed or not.\nThe procedure we usually use is the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator of the survival function.\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator is a step function (like the empirical cdf), which changes value only at the event times, not at the censoring times.\nAt each event time \\(t\\), we compute the at-risk group size \\(Y\\), which is all those observations whose event time or censoring time is at least \\(t\\).\nIf \\(d\\) of the observations have an event time (not a censoring time) of \\(t\\), then the group of survivors immediately following time \\(t\\) is reduced by the fraction \\[\\frac{Y-d}{Y}=1-\\frac{d}{Y}\\]\n\nIf the event times are \\(t_i\\) with events per time of \\(d_i\\) (\\(1\\le i \\le k\\)), then \\[\\hat S(t) = \\prod_{t_i &lt; t}[1-d_i/Y_i]\\] where \\(Y_i\\) is the set of observations whose time (event or censored) is \\(\\ge t_i\\), the group at risk at time \\(t_i\\).\nIf there are no censored data, and there are \\(n\\) data points, then just after (say) the third event time \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat S(t)\n&= \\prod_{t_i &lt; t}[1-d_i/Y_i]\\\\\n&=[\\frac{n-d_1}{n}][\\frac{n-d_1-d_2}{n-d_1}][\\frac{n-d_1-d_2-d_3}{n-d_1-d_2}]\\\\\n&=\\frac{n-d_1-d_2-d_3}{n}\\\\\n&=1-\\frac{d_1+d_2+d_3}{n}\\\\\n&=1-\\hat F(t)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat F(t)\\) is the usual empirical CDF estimate.\n\n5.7.1 Kaplan-Meier curve for drug6mp data\nHere is the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curve for the patients who received 6-MP in the drug6mp dataset (we will see code to produce figures like this one shortly):\n\n\n\nKaplan-Meier Survival Curve for 6-MP Patients\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7.2 Kaplan-Meier calculations\nLet’s compute these estimates and build the chart by hand:\n\nShow R codelibrary(KMsurv)\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndata(drug6mp)\n\ndrug6mp.v2 = \n  drug6mp |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    remstat = remstat |&gt; \n      case_match(\n        1 ~ \"partial\",\n        2 ~ \"complete\"\n      ),\n    # renaming to \"outcome\" while relabeling is just a style choice:\n    outcome = relapse |&gt; \n      case_match(\n        0 ~ \"censored\",\n        1 ~ \"relapsed\"\n      )\n  )\n\nkm.6mp =\n  drug6mp.v2 |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    .by = t2,\n    Relapses = sum(outcome == \"relapsed\"),\n    Censored = sum(outcome == \"censored\")) |&gt;\n  # here we add a start time row, so the graph starts at time 0:\n  bind_rows(\n    tibble(\n      t2 = 0, \n      Relapses = 0, \n      Censored = 0)\n  ) |&gt; \n  # sort in time order:\n  arrange(t2) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Exiting = Relapses + Censored,\n    `Study Size` = sum(Exiting),\n    Exited = cumsum(Exiting) |&gt; dplyr::lag(default = 0),\n    `At Risk` = `Study Size` - Exited,\n    Hazard = Relapses / `At Risk`,\n    `KM Factor` = 1 - Hazard,\n    `Cumulative Hazard` = cumsum(`Hazard`),\n    `KM Survival Curve` = cumprod(`KM Factor`)\n  )\n\nlibrary(pander)  \npander(km.6mp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt2\nRelapses\nCensored\nExiting\nStudy Size\nExited\nAt Risk\nHazard\nKM Factor\nCumulative Hazard\nKM Survival Curve\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n21\n0\n21\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n6\n3\n1\n4\n21\n0\n21\n0.1429\n0.8571\n0.1429\n0.8571\n\n\n7\n1\n0\n1\n21\n4\n17\n0.05882\n0.9412\n0.2017\n0.8067\n\n\n9\n0\n1\n1\n21\n5\n16\n0\n1\n0.2017\n0.8067\n\n\n10\n1\n1\n2\n21\n6\n15\n0.06667\n0.9333\n0.2683\n0.7529\n\n\n11\n0\n1\n1\n21\n8\n13\n0\n1\n0.2683\n0.7529\n\n\n13\n1\n0\n1\n21\n9\n12\n0.08333\n0.9167\n0.3517\n0.6902\n\n\n16\n1\n0\n1\n21\n10\n11\n0.09091\n0.9091\n0.4426\n0.6275\n\n\n17\n0\n1\n1\n21\n11\n10\n0\n1\n0.4426\n0.6275\n\n\n19\n0\n1\n1\n21\n12\n9\n0\n1\n0.4426\n0.6275\n\n\n20\n0\n1\n1\n21\n13\n8\n0\n1\n0.4426\n0.6275\n\n\n22\n1\n0\n1\n21\n14\n7\n0.1429\n0.8571\n0.5854\n0.5378\n\n\n23\n1\n0\n1\n21\n15\n6\n0.1667\n0.8333\n0.7521\n0.4482\n\n\n25\n0\n1\n1\n21\n16\n5\n0\n1\n0.7521\n0.4482\n\n\n32\n0\n2\n2\n21\n17\n4\n0\n1\n0.7521\n0.4482\n\n\n34\n0\n1\n1\n21\n19\n2\n0\n1\n0.7521\n0.4482\n\n\n35\n0\n1\n1\n21\n20\n1\n0\n1\n0.7521\n0.4482\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFor the 6-MP patients at time 6 months, there are 21 patients at risk.

    "text": "6.1 The proportional hazards model\n\n6.1.1 Background on the Proportional Hazards Model\nThe exponential distribution has constant hazard:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(t) &= \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\\nS(t) &= e^{-\\lambda t}\\\\\nh(t) &= \\lambda\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nLet’s make two generalizations. First, we let the hazard depend on some covariates \\(x_1,x_2, \\dots, x_p\\); we will indicate this dependence by extending our notation for hazard:\n\\[h(t|\\boldsymbol x) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}p(T=t|T\\ge t, \\boldsymbol X = \\boldsymbol x)\\]\nSecond, we let the base hazard depend on \\(t\\), but not on the covariates (for now). We can do this using either parametric or semi-parametric approaches.\n\n6.1.2 Cox’s Proportional Hazards Model\nThe generalization is that the hazard function is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(t|x)&= h_0(t)\\theta(x)\\\\\n\\theta(x) &= \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(x)\\right\\}\\\\\n\\eta(x) &= x'\\beta\\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\beta_1x_1+\\cdots+\\beta_px_p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe relationship between \\(h(t|x)\\) and \\(\\eta(x)\\) has a log link (that is, \\(\\text{log}\\left\\{h(t|x)\\right\\} = \\text{log}\\left\\{h_0(t)\\right\\} + \\eta(x)\\)), as in a generalized linear model.\nThis model is semi-parametric, because the linear predictor depends on estimated parameters but the base hazard function is unspecified. There is no constant term in \\(\\eta(x)\\), because it is absorbed in the base hazard.\nAlternatively, we could define \\(\\beta_0(t) = \\text{log}\\left\\{h_0(t)\\right\\}\\), and then \\(\\eta(x,t) = \\beta_0(t) + \\beta_1x_1+\\cdots+\\beta_px_p\\).\nFor two different individuals with covariate patterns \\(\\boldsymbol x_1\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol x_2\\), the ratio of the hazard functions (a.k.a. hazard ratio, a.k.a. relative hazard) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)}\n&=\\frac{h_0(t)\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h_0(t)\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1)}{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nUnder the proportional hazards model, this ratio (a.k.a. proportion) does not depend on \\(t\\). This property is a structural limitation of the model; it is called the proportional hazards assumption.\n\nDefinition 6.1 (proportional hazards) A conditional probability distribution \\(p(T|X)\\) has proportional hazards if the hazard ratio \\(h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)/h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)\\) does not depend on \\(t\\). Mathematically, it can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)}\n= \\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1,\\boldsymbol x_2)\n\\]\n\nAs we saw above, Cox’s proportional hazards model has this property, with \\(\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1,\\boldsymbol x_2) = \\frac{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1)}{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe are using two similar notations, \\(\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1,\\boldsymbol x_2)\\) and \\(\\theta(\\boldsymbol x)\\). We can link these notations if we define \\(\\theta(\\boldsymbol x) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\theta(\\boldsymbol x, \\boldsymbol 0)\\) and \\(\\theta(\\boldsymbol 0) = 1\\).\n\n\nIt also has additional notable properties:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)}\n&=\\frac{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_1)}{\\theta(\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_1)\\right\\}}{\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_2)\\right\\}}\\\\\n&=\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_1)-\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_2)\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\boldsymbol x_1'\\beta-\\boldsymbol x_2'\\beta\\right\\}\\\\\n&=\\text{exp}\\left\\{(\\boldsymbol x_1 - \\boldsymbol x_2)'\\beta\\right\\}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nHence on the log scale, we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{log}\\left\\{\\frac{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\right\\}\n&=\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_1)-\\eta(\\boldsymbol x_2)\\\\\n&= \\boldsymbol x_1'\\beta-\\boldsymbol x_2'\\beta\\\\\n&= (\\boldsymbol x_1 - \\boldsymbol x_2)'\\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf only one covariate \\(x_j\\) is changing, then:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{log}\\left\\{\\frac{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\\boldsymbol x_2)}\\right\\}\n&=  (x_{1j} - x_{2j}) \\cdot \\beta_j\\\\\n&\\propto (x_{1j} - x_{2j})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThat is, under Cox’s model \\(h(t|\\boldsymbol x) = h_0(t)\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\boldsymbol x'\\beta\\right\\}\\), the log of the hazard ratio is proportional to the difference in \\(x_j\\), with the proportionality coefficient equal to \\(\\beta_j\\).\nFurther,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{log}\\left\\{h(t|\\boldsymbol x)\\right\\}\n&=\\text{log}\\left\\{h_0(t)\\right\\}  + x'\\beta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThat is, the covariate effects are additive on the log-hazard scale.\nSee also:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_hazards_model#Why_it_is_called_%22proportional%22\n\n6.1.3 Additional properties of the proportional hazards model\nIf \\(h(t|x)= h_0(t)\\theta(x)\\), then:\nCumulative hazards are also proportional to \\(H_0(t)\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(t|x)\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\int_{u=0}^t h(u)du\\\\\n&= \\int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)\\theta(x)du\\\\\n&= \\theta(x)\\int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)du\\\\\n&= \\theta(x)H_0(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(H_0(t) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}H(t|0) = \\int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)du\\).\nSurvival functions are exponential multiples of \\(S_0(t)\\)\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(t|x)\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{-H(t|x)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\theta(x)\\cdot H_0(t)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\left(\\text{exp}\\left\\{- H_0(t)\\right\\}\\right)^{\\theta(x)}\\\\\n&= \\left(S_0(t)\\right)^{\\theta(x)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(S_0(t) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}P(T\\ge t | \\boldsymbol X = 0)\\) is the survival function for an individual whose covariates are all equal to their default values.\n\n6.1.4 Testing the proportional hazards assumption\nThe Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is usually used for estimates of the hazard and often the cumulative hazard.\nIf the hazards of the three groups are proportional, that means that the ratio of the hazards is constant over \\(t\\). We can test this using the ratios of the estimated cumulative hazards, which also would be proportional, as shown above.\n\nShow R codelibrary(KMsurv)\nlibrary(survival)\ndata(bmt)\n\nbmt = \n  bmt |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    group = \n      group |&gt; \n      factor(\n        labels = c(\"ALL\",\"Low Risk AML\",\"High Risk AML\")))\n\nnafit = survfit(\n  formula = Surv(t2,d3) ~ group,\n  type = \"fleming-harrington\",\n  data = bmt)\n\nbmt_curves = tibble(timevec = 1:1000)\nsf1 &lt;- with(nafit[1], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))\nsf2 &lt;- with(nafit[2], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))\nsf3 &lt;- with(nafit[3], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))\n\nbmt_curves = \n  bmt_curves |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    cumhaz1 = -log(sf1(timevec)),\n    cumhaz2 = -log(sf2(timevec)),\n    cumhaz3 = -log(sf3(timevec)))\n\n\n\nShow R codelibrary(ggplot2)\nbmt_rel_hazard_plot = \n  bmt_curves |&gt; \n  ggplot(\n    aes(\n      x = timevec,\n      y = cumhaz1/cumhaz2)\n  ) +\n  geom_line(aes(col = \"ALL/Low Risk AML\")) + \n  ylab(\"Hazard Ratio\") +\n  xlab(\"Time\") + \n  ylim(0,6) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = cumhaz3/cumhaz1, col = \"High Risk AML/ALL\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = cumhaz3/cumhaz2, col = \"High Risk AML/Low Risk AML\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(colour = \"Comparison\") +\n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\")\n\nprint(bmt_rel_hazard_plot)\n\n\nHazard Ratios by Disease Group\n\n\n\n\nWe can zoom in on 30-300 days to take a closer look:\n\nShow R codebmt_rel_hazard_plot + xlim(c(30,300))\n\n\nHazard Ratios by Disease Group (30-300 Days)\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Smoothed hazard functions\nThe Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is usually used for estimates of the hazard. Since the hazard is the derivative of the cumulative hazard, we need a smooth estimate of the cumulative hazard, which is provided by smoothing the step-function cumulative hazard.\nThe R package muhaz handles this for us. What we are looking for is whether the hazard function is more or less the same shape, increasing, decreasing, constant, etc. Are the hazards “proportional”?\n\nShow R codeplot(\n  survfit(Surv(t2,d3)~group,data=bmt),\n  col=1:3,\n  lwd=2,\n  fun=\"cumhaz\",\n  mark.time = TRUE)\nlegend(\"bottomright\",c(\"ALL\",\"Low Risk AML\",\"High Risk AML\"),col=1:3,lwd=2)\n\n\nDisease-Free Cumulative Hazard by Disease Group\n\n\n\n\n\nShow R codelibrary(muhaz)\n\nmuhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group==\"High Risk AML\") |&gt; plot(lwd=2,col=3)\nmuhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group==\"ALL\") |&gt; lines(lwd=2,col=1)\nmuhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group==\"Low Risk AML\") |&gt; lines(lwd=2,col=2)\nlegend(\"topright\",c(\"ALL\",\"Low Risk AML\",\"High Risk AML\"),col=1:3,lwd=2)\n\n\nSmoothed Hazard Rate Estimates by Disease Group\n\n\n\n\nGroup 3 was plotted first because it has the highest hazard.\nWe will see that except for an initial blip in the high risk AML group, the hazards look roughly proportional . They are all strongly decreasing.\n\n6.1.6 Fitting the Proportional Hazards Model\nHow do we fit a proportional hazards regression model? We need to estimate the coefficients of the covariates, and we need to estimate the base hazard \\(h_0(t)\\). For the covariates, supposing for simplicity that there are no tied event times, let the event times for the whole data set be \\(t_1, t_2,\\ldots,t_D\\). Let the risk set at time \\(t_i\\) be \\(R(t_i)\\) and\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x}) &= \\beta_1x_{1}+\\cdots+\\beta_p x_{p}\\\\\n\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}) &= e^{\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x})}\\\\\nh(t|X=x)&= h_0(t)e^{\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x})}=\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}) h_0(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nConditional on a single failure at time \\(t\\), the probability that the event is due to subject \\(f\\in R(t)\\) is approximately\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Pr(f \\text{ fails}|\\text{1 failure at } t)\n&= \\frac{h_0(t)e^{\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x}_f)}}{\\sum_{k \\in R(t)}h_0(t)e^{\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x}_f)}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}_f)}{\\sum_{k \\in R(t)} \\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}_k)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe logic behind this has several steps. We first fix (ex post) the failure times and note that in this discrete context, the probability \\(p_j\\) that a subject \\(j\\) in the risk set fails at time \\(t\\) is just the hazard of that subject at that time.\nIf all of the \\(p_j\\) are small, the chance that exactly one subject fails is\n\\[\n\\sum_{k\\in R(t)}p_k\\left[\\prod_{m\\in R(t), m\\ne k} (1-p_m)\\right]\\approx\\sum_{k\\in R(t)}p_k\n\\]\nIf subject \\(i\\) is the one who experiences the event of interest at time \\(t_i\\), then the partial likelihood is\n\\[\n\\mathcal L^*(\\beta|T)=\n\\prod_i \\frac{\\theta(x_i)}{\\sum_{k \\in R(t_i)} \\theta(\\boldsymbol{x}_k)}\n\\]\nand we can numerically maximize this with respect to the coefficients \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) that specify \\(\\eta(\\boldsymbol{x}) = \\boldsymbol{x}'\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). When there are tied event times adjustments need to be made, but the likelihood is still similar. Note that we don’t need to know the base hazard to solve for the coefficients.\nOnce we have coefficient estimates \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} =(\\hat \\beta_1,\\ldots,\\hat\\beta_p)\\), this also defines \\(\\hat\\eta(x)\\) and \\(\\hat\\theta(x)\\) and then the estimated base cumulative hazard function is \\[\\hat H(t)=\n\\sum_{t_i &lt; t} \\frac{d_i}{\\sum_{k\\in R(t_i)} \\theta(x_k)}\\] which reduces to the Nelson-Aalen estimate when there are no covariates. There are numerous other estimates that have been proposed as well.",

Group 3 has the highest hazard, so the most significant comparison is not directly shown.\nThe coefficient 0.3834 is on the log-hazard-ratio scale, as in log-risk-ratio. The next column gives the hazard ratio 1.4673, and a hypothesis (Wald) test.\nThe (not shown) group 3 vs. group 2 log hazard ratio is 0.3834 + 0.5742 = 0.9576. The hazard ratio is then exp(0.9576) or 2.605.\nInference on all coefficients and combinations can be constructed using coef(bmt.cox) and vcov(bmt.cox) as with logistic and poisson regression.\nConcordance is agreement of first failure between pairs of subjects and higher predicted risk between those subjects, omitting non-informative pairs.\nThe Rsquare value is Cox and Snell’s pseudo R-squared and is not very useful.\nsummary() prints three tests for whether the model with the group covariate is better than the one without\n\n\nLikelihood ratio test (chi-squared)\n\nWald test (also chi-squared), obtained by adding the squares of the z-scores\n\nScore = log-rank test, as with comparison of survival functions.\n\nThe likelihood ratio test is probably best in smaller samples, followed by the Wald test.\n\n6.2.2 Survival Curves from the Cox Model\nWe can take a look at the resulting group-specific curves:\n\nShow R code#| fig-cap: \"Survival Functions for Three Groups by KM and Cox Model\"\n\nkm_fit = survfit(Surv(t2, d3) ~ group, data = as.data.frame(bmt))\n\ncox_fit = survfit(\n  bmt.cox, \n  newdata = \n    data.frame(\n      group = unique(bmt$group), \n      row.names = unique(bmt$group)))\n\nlibrary(survminer)\n\nlist(KM = km_fit, Cox = cox_fit) |&gt; \n  survminer::ggsurvplot(\n    # facet.by = \"group\",\n    legend = \"bottom\", \n    legend.title = \"\",\n    combine = TRUE, \n    fun = 'pct', \n    size = .5,\n    ggtheme = theme_bw(), \n    conf.int = FALSE, \n    censor = FALSE) |&gt; \n  suppressWarnings() # ggsurvplot() throws some warnings that aren't too worrying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we use survfit() with a Cox model, we have to specify the covariate levels we are interested in; the argument newdata should include a data.frame with the same named columns as the predictors in the Cox model and one or more levels of each.\nOtherwise (that is, if the newdata argument is missing), a curve is produced for a single “pseudo” subject with covariate values equal to the means component of the fit.\nThe resulting curve(s) almost never make sense, but the default remains due to an unwarranted attachment to the option shown by some users and by other packages.\nTwo particularly egregious examples are factor variables and interactions. Suppose one were studying interspecies transmission of a virus, and the data set has a factor variable with levels (“pig”, “chicken”) and about equal numbers of observations for each. The “mean” covariate level will be 0.5 – is this a flying pig?\n\n6.2.3 Examining survfit\n\n\nShow R codesurvfit(Surv(t2, d3)~group,data=bmt)\n\nCall: survfit(formula = Surv(t2, d3) ~ group, data =

It works best when the number of ties is small. It is the default in many statistical packages, including PROC PHREG in SAS.\nEfron’s method for ties\nThe other common method is Efron’s, which is the default in R.\n\\[L(\\beta|T)=\n\\prod_i \\frac{\\bar\\theta_i}{\\prod_{j=1}^{d_i}[\\sum_{k \\in R(t_i)} \\theta_k-\\frac{j-1}{d_i}\\sum_{k \\in D_i} \\theta_k]}\\] This is closer to the exact discrete partial likelihood when there are many ties.\nThe third option in R (and an option also in SAS as discrete) is the “exact” method, which is the same one used for matched logistic regression.\nExample: Breslow’s method\nSuppose as an example we have a time \\(t\\) where there are 20 individuals at risk and three failures. Let the three individuals have risk parameters \\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\theta_3\\) and let the sum of the risk parameters of the remaining 17 individuals be \\(\\theta_R\\). Then the factor in the partial likelihood at time \\(t\\) using Breslow’s method is\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_R+\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_R+\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_3}{\\theta_R+\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nIf on the other hand, they had died in the order 1,2, 3, then the contribution to the partial likelihood would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_R+\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_R+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_3}{\\theta_R+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nas the risk set got smaller with each failure. The exact method roughly averages the results for the six possible orderings of the failures.\nExample: Efron’s method\nBut we don’t know the order they failed in, so instead of reducing the denominator by one risk coefficient each time, we reduce it by the same fraction. This is Efron’s method.\n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_R+\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_2}{\\theta_R+2(\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3)/3}\\right)\n\\left(\\frac{\\theta_3}{\\theta_R+(\\theta_1+\\theta_2+\\theta_3)/3}\\right)\\]",

    "text": "7.3 Predictions and Residuals\n\n7.3.1 Review: Predictions in Linear Regression\n\nIn linear regression, we have a linear predictor for each data point \\(i\\)\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\eta_i &= \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{1i}+\\cdots+\\beta_px_{pi}\\\\\n\\hat y_i &=\\hat\\eta_i = \\hat\\beta_0+\\hat\\beta_1x_{1i}+\\cdots+\\hat\\beta_px_{pi}\\\\\ny_i &\\sim N(\\eta_i,\\sigma^2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\\(\\hat y_i\\) estimates the conditional mean of \\(y_i\\) given the covariate values \\(\\tilde x_i\\). This together with the prediction error says that we are predicting the distribution of values of \\(y\\).\n\n7.3.2 Review: Residuals in Linear Regression\n\nThe usual residual is \\(r_i=y_i-\\hat y_i\\), the difference between the actual value of \\(y\\) and a prediction of its mean.\nThe residuals are also the quantities the sum of whose squares is being minimized by the least squares/MLE estimation.\n\n7.3.3 Predictions and Residuals in survival models\n\nIn survival analysis, the equivalent of \\(y_i\\) is the event time \\(t_i\\), which is unknown for the censored observations.\nThe expected event time can be tricky to calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{\\text{E}}[T|X=x] = \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\hat S(t)dt\n\\]\n\n7.3.4 Wide prediction intervals\nThe nature of time-to-event data results in very wide prediction intervals:\n\nSuppose a cancer patient is predicted to have a mean lifetime of 5 years after diagnosis and suppose the distribution is exponential.\nIf we want a 95% interval for survival, the lower end is at the 0.025 percentage point of the exponential which is qexp(.025, rate = 1/5) = 0.12658904 years, or 1/40 of the mean lifetime.\nThe upper end is at the 0.975 point which is qexp(.975, rate = 1/5) = 18.44439727 years, or 3.7 times the mean lifetime.\nSaying that the survival time is somewhere between 6 weeks and 18 years does not seem very useful, but it may be the best we can do.\nFor survival analysis, something is like a residual if it is small when the model is accurate or if the accumulation of them is in some way minimized by the estimation algorithm, but there is no exact equivalence to linear regression residuals.\nAnd if there is, they are mostly quite large!\n\n7.3.5 Types of Residuals in Time-to-Event Models\n\nIt is often hard to make a decision from graph appearances, though the process can reveal much.\nSome diagnostic tests are based on residuals as with other regression methods:\n\nSchoenfeld residuals (via cox.zph) for proportionality.\n\nCox-Snell residuals for goodness of fit.\n\nmartingale residuals for non-linearity.\n\ndfbeta for influence.\n\n7.3.6 Schoenfeld residuals\n\nThere is a Schoenfeld residual for each subject \\(i\\) with an event (not censored) and for each predictor \\(x_{k}\\).\nAt the event time \\(t\\) for that subject, there is a risk set \\(R\\), and each subject \\(j\\) in the risk set has a risk coefficient \\(\\theta_j\\) and also a value \\(x_{jk}\\) of the predictor.\nThe Schoenfeld residual is the difference between \\(x_{ik}\\) and the risk-weighted average of all the \\(x_{jk}\\) over the risk set.\n\n\\[\nr^S_{ik} =\nx_{ik}-\\frac{\\sum_{k\\in R}x_{jk}\\theta_k}{\\sum_{k\\in R}\\theta_k}\n\\]\nThis residual measures how typical the individual subject is with respect to the covariate at the time of the event. Since subjects should fail more or less uniformly according to risk, the Schoenfeld residuals should be approximately level over time, not increasing or decreasing.\nWe can test this with the correlation with time on some scale, which could be the time itself, the log time, or the rank in the set of failure times.\nThe default is to use the KM curve as a transform, which is similar to the rank but deals better with censoring.\nThe cox.zph() function implements a score test proposed in Grambsch and Therneau (1994).\n\nShow R codehodg.zph = cox.zph(hodg.cox1)\nprint(hodg.zph)\n\n               chisq df      p\ngtype        0.53998  1 0.4624\ndtype        1.80125  1 0.1796\nscore        3.88050  1 0.0489\nwtime        0.01728  1 0.8954\ngtype:dtype  4.04744  1 0.0442\nGLOBAL      13.75732  5 0.0172\n\n\ngtype\n\nShow R codeggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = \"gtype\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndtype\n\nShow R codeggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = \"dtype\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscore\n\nShow R codeggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = \"score\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwtime\n\nShow R codeggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = \"wtime\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngtype:dtype\n\nShow R codeggcoxzph(hodg.zph, var = \"gtype:dtype\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nFrom the correlation test, the Karnofsky score and the interaction with graft type disease type induce modest but statistically significant non-proportionality.\nThe sample size here is relatively small (26 events in 43 subjects). If the sample size is large, very small amounts of non-proportionality can induce a significant result.\nAs time goes on, autologous grafts are over-represented at their own event times, but those from HOD patients become less represented.\nBoth the statistical tests and the plots are useful.",

    "text": "7.5 Martingale Residuals\nThe martingale residuals are a slight modification of the Cox-Snell residuals. If the censoring indicator is \\(\\delta_i\\), then \\[r^M_i=\\delta_i-r^{CS}_i\\] These residuals can be interpreted as an estimate of the excess number of events seen in the data but not predicted by the model. We will use these to examine the functional forms of continuous covariates.\n\n7.5.1 Using Martingale Residuals\nMartingale residuals can be used to examine the functional form of a numeric variable.\n\nWe fit the model without that variable and compute the martingale residuals.\nWe then plot these martingale residuals against the values of the variable.\nWe can see curvature, or a possible suggestion that the variable can be discretized.\n\nLet’s use this to examine the score and wtime variables in the wtime data set.\nKarnofsky score\n\nShow R codehodg2 = hodg2 |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    mres = \n      hodg.cox1 |&gt; \n      update(. ~ . - score) |&gt; \n      residuals(type=\"martingale\"))\n\nhodg2 |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = score, y = mres)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", aes(col = \"loess\")) +\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', aes(col = \"lm\")) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  xlab(\"Karnofsky Score\") +\n  ylab(\"Martingale Residuals\") +\n  guides(col=guide_legend(title = \"\"))\n\n\nMartingale Residuals vs. Karnofsky Score\n\n\n\n\nThe line is almost straight.

To see where the drop is, we can look at the largest waiting times and the associated martingale residual.\nThe martingale residuals are all negative for wtime &gt;83 and positive for the next smallest value.

In this case, observations 15 and 16 may show some trouble with the dichotomization of waiting time, but it still may be useful.\nThe two largest residuals seem to be due to unexpectedly early deaths, but unfortunately this can occur.\nIf hazards don’t look proportional, then we may need to use strata, between which the base hazards are permitted to be different. For this problem, the natural strata are the two diseases, because they could need to be managed differently anyway.\nA main point that we want to be sure of is the relative risk difference by disease type and graft type.\n\n\nShow R codehodg.cox2 |&gt; \n  predict(\n    reference = \"zero\",\n    newdata = means |&gt; \n      mutate(\n        wt2 = \"short\", \n        score = 0), \n    type = \"lp\") |&gt; \n  data.frame('linear predictor' = _) |&gt; \n  pander()\n\n\nLinear Risk Predictors for Lymphoma\n\n\n\n\n\n \nlinear.predictor\n\n\n\nNon-Hodgkins,Allogenic\n0\n\n\nNon-Hodgkins,Autologous\n0.6651\n\n\nHodgkins,Allogenic\n2.327\n\n\nHodgkins,Autologous\n0.9256\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Non-Hodgkin’s, the allogenic graft is better.

for example one from t = 0 to the time of platelet recovery, and one from that time to relapse, recovery, or death.\nWe do the same for acute GVHD and chronic GVHD.\nFor each record, the covariates are constant.\n\n\nShow R codebmt2 = bmt1 |&gt; \n  #set up new long-format data set:\n  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, tstop = t2) |&gt; \n  \n  # the following three steps can be in any order, \n  # and will still produce the same result:\n  #add aghvd as tdc:\n  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, agvhd = tdc(ta)) |&gt; \n  #add cghvd as tdc:\n  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, cgvhd = tdc(tc)) |&gt; \n  #add platelet recovery as tdc:\n  tmerge(bmt1, id = id, precovery = tdc(tp))   \n\nbmt2 = bmt2 |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt; \n  mutate(status = as.numeric((tstop == t2) & d3))\n# status only = 1 if at end of t2 and not censored\n\n\nLet’s see how we’ve rearranged the first row of the data:\n\nShow R codebmt1 |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(id == 1) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(id, t1, d1, t2, d2, d3, ta, da, tc, dc, tp, dp)\n\n\n\nid\nt1\nd1\nt2\nd2\nd3\nta\nda\ntc\ndc\ntp\ndp\n\n\n1\n2081\n0\n2081\n0\n0\n67\n1\n121\n1\n13\n1\n\n\n\n\nThe event times for this individual are:\n\n\nt = 0 time of transplant\n\ntp = 13 platelet recovery\n\nta = 67 acute GVHD onset\n\ntc = 121 chronic GVHD onset\n\nt2 = 2081 end of study, patient not relapsed or dead\n\nAfter converting the data to long-format, we have:\n\nShow R codebmt2 |&gt; \n  select(\n    id,\n    tstart,\n    tstop,\n    agvhd,\n    cgvhd,\n    precovery,\n    status\n  ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(id == 1)\n\n\n\nid\ntstart\ntstop\nagvhd\ncgvhd\nprecovery\nstatus\n\n\n\n1\n0\n13\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n13\n67\n0\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n67\n121\n1\n0\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n121\n2081\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that status could have been 1 on the last row, indicating that relapse or death occurred; since it is false, the participant must have exited the study without experiencing relapse or death (i.e., they were censored).\n\n7.8.4 Event sequences\nLet:\n\nA = acute GVHD\nC = chronic GVHD\nP = platelet recovery\n\nEach of the eight possible combinations of A or not-A, with C or not-C, with P or not-P occurs in this data set.\n\nA always occurs before C, and P always occurs before C, if both occur.\nThus there are ten event sequences in the data set: None, A, C, P, AC, AP, PA, PC, APC, and PAC.\nIn general, there could be as many as \\(1+3+(3)(2)+6=16\\) sequences, but our domain knowledge tells us that some are missing: CA, CP, CAP, CPA, PCA, PC, PAC\nDifferent subjects could have 1, 2, 3, or 4 intervals, depending on which of acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, and/or platelet recovery occurred.\nThe final interval for any subject has status = 1 if the subject relapsed or died at that time; otherwise status = 0.\nAny earlier intervals have status = 0.\nEven though there might be multiple lines per ID in the dataset, there is never more than one event, so no alterations need be made in the estimation procedures or in the interpretation of the output.\nThe function tmerge in the survival package eases the process of constructing the new long-format dataset.\n\n7.8.5 Model with Time-Fixed Covariates\n\nShow R codebmt1 = \n  bmt1 |&gt;

    "text": "7.9 Recurrent Events\n(Adapted from Kleinbaum and Klein, Ch 8)\n\nSometimes an appropriate analysis requires consideration of recurrent events.\nA patient with arthritis may have more than one flareup. The same is true of many recurring-remitting diseases.\nIn this case, we have more than one line in the data frame, but each line may have an event.\nWe have to use a “robust” variance estimator to account for correlation of time-to-events within a patient.\n\n\n7.9.1 Bladder Cancer Data Set\nThe bladder cancer dataset from Kleinbaum and Klein contains recurrent event outcome information for eighty-six cancer patients followed for the recurrence of bladder cancer tumor after transurethral surgical excision (Byar and Green 1980). The exposure of interest is the effect of the drug treatment of thiotepa. Control variables are the initial number and initial size of tumors. The data layout is suitable for a counting processes approach.\nThis drug is still a possible choice for some patients.

This has a log link as in a generalized linear model. Since the hazard does not depend on \\(t\\), the hazards are (trivially) proportional.\n\n8.1.4 Accelerated Failure Time\nPreviously, we assumed the hazards were proportional; that is, the covariates multiplied the baseline hazard function:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(T=t|X=x)\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} p(T=t|X=x,T \\ge t)\\\\\n&= h(t|X=0)\\cdot \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(x)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= h(t|X=0)\\cdot \\theta(x)\\\\\n&= h_0(t)\\cdot \\theta(x)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nand correspondingly,\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(t|x)\n&= \\theta(x)H_0(t)\\\\\nS(t|x)\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{-H(t|x)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\theta(x)\\cdot H_0(t)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= \\left(\\text{exp}\\left\\{- H_0(t)\\right\\}\\right)^{\\theta(x)}\\\\\n&= \\left(S_0(t)\\right)^{\\theta(x)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAn alternative modeling assumption would be \\[S(t|X=x)=S_0(t\\cdot \\theta(x))\\] where \\(\\theta(x)=\\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(x)\\right\\}\\), \\(\\eta(x) =\\beta_1x_1+\\cdots+\\beta_px_p\\), and \\(S_0(t)=P(T\\ge t|X=0)\\) is the base survival function.\nThen\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nE(T|X=x)\n&= \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty} S(t|x)dt\\\\\n&= \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty} S_0(t\\cdot \\theta(x))dt\\\\\n&= \\int_{u=0}^{\\infty} S_0(u)du \\cdot \\theta(x)^{-1}\\\\\n&= \\theta(x)^{-1} \\cdot \\int_{u=0}^{\\infty} S_0(u)du\\\\\n&= \\theta(x)^{-1} \\cdot \\text{E}(T|X=0)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] So the mean of \\(T\\) given \\(X=x\\) is the baseline mean divided by \\(\\theta(x) = \\text{exp}\\left\\{\\eta(x)\\right\\}\\).\nThis modeling strategy is called an accelerated failure time model, because covariates cause uniform acceleration (or slowing) of failure times.\nAdditionally:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(t|x) &= H_0(\\theta(x)\\cdot t)\\\\\nh(t|x) &= \\theta(x) \\cdot h_0(\\theta(x)\\cdot t)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIf the base distribution is exponential with parameter \\(\\lambda\\) then\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS(t|x)\n&= \\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\lambda \\cdot t \\theta(x)\\right\\}\\\\\n&= [\\text{exp}\\left\\{-\\lambda t\\right\\}]^{\\theta(x)}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich is an exponential model with base hazard multiplied by \\(\\theta(x)\\), which is also the proportional hazards model.\n\nIn terms of the log survival time \\(Y=\\text{log}\\left\\{T\\right\\}\\) the model can be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY&=\\alpha-\\eta+W\\\\\n\\alpha&= -\\text{log}\\left\\{\\lambda\\right\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) has the extreme value distribution. The estimated parameter \\(\\lambda\\) is the intercept and the other coefficients are those of \\(\\eta\\), which will be the opposite sign of those for coxph.\n\nFor a Weibull distribution, the hazard function and the survival function are\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(t)&=\\lambda p (\\lambda t)^{p-1}\\\\\nS(t)&=e^{-(\\lambda t)^p}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWe can construct a proportional hazards model by using a linear predictor \\(\\eta_i\\) without constant term and letting \\(\\theta_i=e^{\\eta_i}\\) we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nh(t)&=\\lambda p (\\lambda t)^{p-1}\\theta_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nA distribution with \\(h(t)=\\lambda p (\\lambda t)^{p-1}\\theta_i\\) is a Weibull distribution with parameters \\(\\lambda^*=\\lambda \\theta_i^{1/p}\\) and \\(p\\) so the survival function is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nS^*(t)&=e^{-(\\lambda^* t)^p}\\\\\n&=e^{-(\\lambda \\theta^{1/p} t)^p}\\\\\n&= S(t\\theta^{1/p})\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nso this is also an accelerated failure time model.\n\nIn terms of the log survival time \\(Y=\\text{log}\\left\\{T\\right\\}\\) the model can be written as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nY&=\\alpha-\\sigma\\eta+\\sigma W\\\\\n\\alpha&= -\\text{log}\\left\\{\\lambda\\right\\}\\\\\n\\sigma &= 1/p\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) has the extreme value distribution.

The exponential and the Weibull are the only log-linear models that are simultaneously proportional hazards models.

Data is only produced when scientists implement an observation process (i.e., a scientific study), which is distinct from the underlying physical process. In some cases, the observation process and the physical process interact with each other. This phenomenon is called the “observer effect”.\nIn order to learn about the physical processes we are ultimately interested in, we often need to make special considerations for the observation process that produced the data which we are analyzing. In particular, if some of the planned observations in the study design were not completed, we will likely need to account for the incompleteness of the resulting data set in our analysis. If we are not sure why some observations are incomplete, we may need to model the observation process in addition to the physical process we were originally interested in. For example, if some participants in a study dropped out part-way through the study, we may need investigate why those participants dropped out, as opposed to other participants who completed the study.\nThese kinds of missing data issues are outside of the scope of this course; see Van Buuren (2018) for more details.",

If \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is unbiased, then:\nEquation B.2:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) &= 0\\\\\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat\\theta\\right] - \\theta &= 0\\\\\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat\\theta\\right] &= \\theta\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nEquation B.3:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{MSE}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\epsilon(\\hat\\theta)\\right)^2\\right]\\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\hat\\theta- \\theta\\right)^2\\right]\\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\hat\\theta- \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat\\theta\\right]\\right)^2\\right]\\\\\n&\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n(Alternative proof of Equation B.3) We could have started from Theorem B.2 instead:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{MSE}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\n&= \\left(\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\right)^2 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\\\\n&= \\left(0\\right)^2 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\\\\n&= 0 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\\\\n&= \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB.3.6 Standard error\n\nDefinition B.11 (Standard error) The standard error of an estimator \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is just the standard deviation of \\(\\hat\\theta\\); that is:\n\\[\\text{se}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\text{sd}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\]\n\n“Standard error” is a confusing concept in a few ways. First of all, it isn’t even defined as a characteristic of the error, \\(\\epsilon(\\hat\\theta)\\)! Moreover, it is just a synonym for standard deviation, so it seems like a redundant concept. However, standard errors help us construct p-values and confidence intervals, so they come up a lot - often enough to give them their own name.\nWe can relate standard error to actual error, by rearranging the result from Theorem B.2:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) &= \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta- \\theta\\right)\\\\\n&= \\text{Var}\\left(\\epsilon(\\hat\\theta)\\right)\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] So the variance of the estimator is equal to the variance of the error, and the standard error is equal to the standard deviation of the error.\nAnother result:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{MSE}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) &= \\left(\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\right)^2 + \\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\\\\n\\therefore\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) &= \\text{MSE}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right) - \\left(\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat\\theta\\right)\\right)^2\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Essentially, standard error is what is left of MSE after bias is removed. For unbiased estimators, SE = RMSE (this is an equivalent result to Equation B.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLawrance, Rachael, Evgeny Degtyarev, Philip Griffiths, Peter Trask, Helen Lau, Denise D’Alessio, Ingolf Griebsch, Gudrun Wallenstein, Kim Cocks, and Kaspar Rufibach. 2020. “What Is an Estimand, and How Does It Relate to Quantifying the Effect of Treatment on Patient-Reported Quality of Life Outcomes in Clinical Trials?” Journal of Patient-Reported Outcomes 4 (1): 1–8.\n\n\nPohl, Moritz, Lukas Baumann, Rouven Behnisch, Marietta Kirchner, Johannes Krisam, and Anja Sander. 2021. “Estimands—A Basic Element for Clinical Trials.” Deutsches Ärzteblatt International 118 (51-52): 883–88. https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2021.0373.\n\n\nVan Buuren, Stef. 2018.

Note that this is the opposite of the substitution that we are making for estimating the variance of the MLE; this time we should technically use the observed information but we use the expected information instead.\nThere’s also an “empirical information matrix” (see McLachlan and Krishnan 2007).\n\\[I_{e}(\\theta,y) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\\ell_{i}^{'}\\ {\\ell_{i}^{'}}^{\\top}} - \\frac{1}{n}\\ell^{'}{\\ell^{'}}^{\\top}\\]\nwhere \\(\\ell_{i}\\) is the log-likelihood of the ith observation.
