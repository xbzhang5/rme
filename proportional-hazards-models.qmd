## The proportional hazards model

### Background on the Proportional Hazards Model

The exponential distribution has constant hazard:

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= \lambda e^{-\lambda t}\\
S(t) &= e^{-\lambda t}\\
h(t) &= \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

Let's make two generalizations. First, we let the hazard depend on some
covariates $x_1,x_2, \dots, x_p$; we will indicate this dependence by extending our notation for hazard:

$$h(t|\boldsymbol x) \eqdef p(T=t|T\ge t, \boldsymbol X = \boldsymbol x)$$

Second, we let the base hazard depend on $t$, but not on the covariates (for now). We can do this using either parametric or semi-parametric approaches.

### Cox's Proportional Hazards Model

The generalization is that the hazard function is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t|x)&= h_0(t)\theta(x)\\
\theta(x) &= \exp{\eta(x)}\\
\eta(x) &= x'\beta\\
&\eqdef \beta_1x_1+\cdots+\beta_px_p
\end{aligned}
$$

The relationship between $h(t|x)$ and $\eta(x)$ has a log link (that is, $\log{h(t|x)} = \log{h_0(t)} + \eta(x)$), as in a generalized linear model.

This model is **semi-parametric**, because the linear predictor depends on estimated
parameters but the base hazard function is unspecified. 
There is no constant term in $\eta(x)$, because it is absorbed in the base hazard. 

Alternatively, we could define $\beta_0(t) = \log{h_0(t)}$, and then $\eta(x,t) = \beta_0(t) + \beta_1x_1+\cdots+\beta_px_p$.

For two different individuals with covariate patterns $\boldsymbol x_1$ and $\boldsymbol x_2$, the ratio of the hazard functions (a.k.a. **hazard ratio**, a.k.a. **relative hazard**) is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)}
&=\frac{h_0(t)\theta(\boldsymbol x_1)}{h_0(t)\theta(\boldsymbol x_2)}\\
&=\frac{\theta(\boldsymbol x_1)}{\theta(\boldsymbol x_2)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Under the proportional hazards model, this ratio (a.k.a. proportion) does not depend on $t$. This property is a structural limitation of the model; it is called the **proportional hazards assumption**.

### proportional hazards

A conditional probability distribution $p(T|X)$ has **proportional hazards** if the hazard ratio $h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)/h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)$ does not depend on $t$. Mathematically, it can be written as:

$$
\frac{h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)}
= \theta(\boldsymbol x_1,\boldsymbol x_2)
$$

:::

As we saw above, Cox's proportional hazards model has this property, with $\theta(\boldsymbol x_1,\boldsymbol x_2) = \frac{\theta(\boldsymbol x_1)}{\theta(\boldsymbol x_2)}$.

:::{.callout-note}

We are using two similar notations, $\theta(\boldsymbol x_1,\boldsymbol x_2)$ and $\theta(\boldsymbol x)$. We can link these notations if we define $\theta(\boldsymbol x) \eqdef \theta(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol 0)$ and $\theta(\boldsymbol 0) = 1$.

:::

It also has additional notable properties:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)}
&=\frac{\theta(\boldsymbol x_1)}{\theta(\boldsymbol x_2)}\\
&=\frac{\exp{\eta(\boldsymbol x_1)}}{\exp{\eta(\boldsymbol x_2)}}\\
&=\exp{\eta(\boldsymbol x_1)-\eta(\boldsymbol x_2)}\\
&=\exp{\boldsymbol x_1'\beta-\boldsymbol x_2'\beta}\\
&=\exp{(\boldsymbol x_1 - \boldsymbol x_2)'\beta}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Hence on the log scale, we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log{\frac{h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)}}
&=\eta(\boldsymbol x_1)-\eta(\boldsymbol x_2)\\
&= \boldsymbol x_1'\beta-\boldsymbol x_2'\beta\\
&= (\boldsymbol x_1 - \boldsymbol x_2)'\beta
\end{aligned}
$$ 

If only one covariate $x_j$ is changing, then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log{\frac{h(t|\boldsymbol x_1)}{h(t|\boldsymbol x_2)}} 
&=  (x_{1j} - x_{2j}) \cdot \beta_j\\
&\propto (x_{1j} - x_{2j})
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, under Cox's model $h(t|\boldsymbol x) = h_0(t)\exp{\boldsymbol x'\beta}$, the log of the hazard ratio is proportional to the difference in $x_j$, with the proportionality coefficient equal to $\beta_j$.

Further,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\log{h(t|\boldsymbol x)}
&=\log{h_0(t)}  + x'\beta
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, the covariate effects are additive on the log-hazard scale.

### Additional properties of the proportional hazards model

If $h(t|x)= h_0(t)\theta(x)$, then:

#### Cumulative hazards are also proportional to $H_0(t)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(t|x)
&\eqdef \int_{u=0}^t h(u)du\\
&= \int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)\theta(x)du\\
&= \theta(x)\int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)du\\
&= \theta(x)H_0(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $H_0(t) \eqdef H(t|0) = \int_{u=0}^t h_0(u)du$.

#### Survival functions are exponential multiples of $S_0(t)$

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(t|x)
&= \exp{-H(t|x)}\\
&= \exp{-\theta(x)\cdot H_0(t)}\\
&= \left(\exp{- H_0(t)}\right)^{\theta(x)}\\
&= \left(S_0(t)\right)^{\theta(x)}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $S_0(t) \eqdef P(T\ge t | \boldsymbol X = 0)$ is the survival function for an individual whose covariates are all equal to their default values.

### Testing the proportional hazards assumption

The Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is usually used for estimates of the hazard and often the cumulative hazard.

If the hazards of the three groups are proportional, that means that the ratio of the hazards is constant over $t$. We can test this using the ratios of the estimated cumulative hazards, which also would be
proportional, as shown above.

```{r}

library(KMsurv)
library(survival)
data(bmt)

bmt = 
  bmt |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    group = 
      group |> 
      factor(
        labels = c("ALL","Low Risk AML","High Risk AML")))

nafit = survfit(
  formula = Surv(t2,d3) ~ group,
  type = "fleming-harrington",
  data = bmt)

bmt_curves = tibble(timevec = 1:1000)
sf1 <- with(nafit[1], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))
sf2 <- with(nafit[2], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))
sf3 <- with(nafit[3], stepfun(time,c(1,surv)))

bmt_curves = 
  bmt_curves |> 
  mutate(
    cumhaz1 = -log(sf1(timevec)),
    cumhaz2 = -log(sf2(timevec)),
    cumhaz3 = -log(sf3(timevec)))
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Hazard Ratios by Disease Group"
library(ggplot2)
bmt_rel_hazard_plot = 
  bmt_curves |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = timevec,
      y = cumhaz1/cumhaz2)
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(col = "ALL/Low Risk AML")) + 
  ylab("Hazard Ratio") +
  xlab("Time") + 
  ylim(0,6) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumhaz3/cumhaz1, col = "High Risk AML/ALL")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = cumhaz3/cumhaz2, col = "High Risk AML/Low Risk AML")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(colour = "Comparison") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

print(bmt_rel_hazard_plot)
```

We can zoom in on 30-300 days to take a closer look:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Hazard Ratios by Disease Group (30-300 Days)"
bmt_rel_hazard_plot + xlim(c(30,300))
```

### Smoothed hazard functions

The Nelson-Aalen estimate of the cumulative hazard is usually used for
estimates of the hazard. Since the hazard is the derivative of the
cumulative hazard, we need a smooth estimate of the cumulative hazard,
which is provided by smoothing the step-function cumulative hazard.

The R package `muhaz` handles this for us. What we are looking for is
whether the hazard function is more or less the same shape, increasing,
decreasing, constant, etc. Are the hazards "proportional"?

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Disease-Free Cumulative Hazard by Disease Group"
plot(
  survfit(Surv(t2,d3)~group,data=bmt),
  col=1:3,
  lwd=2,
  fun="cumhaz",
  mark.time = TRUE)
legend("bottomright",c("ALL","Low Risk AML","High Risk AML"),col=1:3,lwd=2)

```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Smoothed Hazard Rate Estimates by Disease Group"
library(muhaz)

muhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group=="High Risk AML") |> plot(lwd=2,col=3)
muhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group=="ALL") |> lines(lwd=2,col=1)
muhaz(bmt$t2,bmt$d3,bmt$group=="Low Risk AML") |> lines(lwd=2,col=2)
legend("topright",c("ALL","Low Risk AML","High Risk AML"),col=1:3,lwd=2)
```

Group 3 was plotted first because it has the highest hazard.

We will see that except for an initial blip in the high risk AML group,
the hazards look roughly proportional . They are all strongly
decreasing.

### Fitting the Proportional Hazards Model

How do we fit a proportional hazards regression model? We need to
estimate the coefficients of the covariates, and we need to estimate the
base hazard $h_0(t)$. For the covariates, supposing for simplicity that
there are no tied event times, let the event times for the whole data
set be $t_1, t_2,\ldots,t_D$. Let the risk set at time $t_i$ be $R(t_i)$
and 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\eta(\boldsymbol{x}) &= \beta_1x_{1}+\cdots+\beta_p x_{p}\\
\theta(\boldsymbol{x}) &= e^{\eta(\boldsymbol{x})}\\
h(t|X=x)&= h_0(t)e^{\eta(\boldsymbol{x})}=\theta(\boldsymbol{x}) h_0(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Conditional on a single failure at time $t$, the probability that the
event is due to subject $f\in R(t)$ is approximately

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(f \text{ fails}|\text{1 failure at } t) 
&= \frac{h_0(t)e^{\eta(\boldsymbol{x}_f)}}{\sum_{k \in R(t)}h_0(t)e^{\eta(\boldsymbol{x}_f)}}\\
&=\frac{\theta(\boldsymbol{x}_f)}{\sum_{k \in R(t)} \theta(\boldsymbol{x}_k)}
\end{aligned}
$$ 

The logic behind this has several steps. We first fix (ex post) the
failure times and note that in this discrete context, the probability
$p_j$ that a subject $j$ in the risk set fails at time $t$ is just the
hazard of that subject at that time.

If all of the $p_j$ are small, the chance that exactly one subject fails
is

$$
\sum_{k\in R(t)}p_k\left[\prod_{m\in R(t), m\ne k} (1-p_m)\right]\approx\sum_{k\in R(t)}p_k
$$

If subject $i$ is the one who experiences the event of interest at time
$t_i$, then the **partial likelihood** is

$$
\mathcal L^*(\beta|T)=
\prod_i \frac{\theta(x_i)}{\sum_{k \in R(t_i)} \theta(\boldsymbol{x}_k)}
$$

and we can numerically maximize this with respect to the coefficients
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$ that specify
$\eta(\boldsymbol{x}) = \boldsymbol{x}'\boldsymbol{\beta}$. When there
are tied event times adjustments need to be made, but the likelihood is
still similar. Note that we don't need to know the base hazard to solve
for the coefficients.

Once we have coefficient estimates
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} =(\hat \beta_1,\ldots,\hat\beta_p)$, this also
defines $\hat\eta(x)$ and $\hat\theta(x)$ and then the estimated base
cumulative hazard function is $$\hat H(t)=
\sum_{t_i < t} \frac{d_i}{\sum_{k\in R(t_i)} \theta(x_k)}$$ which
reduces to the Nelson-Aalen estimate when there are no covariates. There
are numerous other estimates that have been proposed as well.

## Cox Model for the `bmt` data

### Fit the model

```{r}

bmt.cox <- coxph(Surv(t2, d3) ~ group, data = bmt)
summary(bmt.cox)
```

The table provides hypothesis tests comparing groups 2 and 3 to group 1.
Group 3 has the highest hazard, so the most significant comparison is
not directly shown.

The coefficient 0.3834 is on the log-hazard-ratio scale, as in
log-risk-ratio. The next column gives the hazard ratio 1.4673, and a
hypothesis (Wald) test.

The (not shown) group 3 vs. group 2 log hazard ratio is 0.3834 + 0.5742
= 0.9576. The hazard ratio is then exp(0.9576) or 2.605.

Inference on all coefficients and combinations can be constructed using
`coef(bmt.cox)` and `vcov(bmt.cox)` as with logistic and poisson
regression.

**Concordance** is agreement of first failure between pairs of subjects
and higher predicted risk between those subjects, omitting
non-informative pairs.

The Rsquare value is Cox and Snell's pseudo R-squared and is not very
useful.

`summary()` prints three tests for whether the model with the group
covariate is better than the one without

-   `Likelihood ratio test` (chi-squared)
-   `Wald test` (also chi-squared), obtained by adding the squares of the z-scores
-   `Score` = log-rank test, as with comparison of survival functions.

The likelihood ratio test is probably best in smaller samples, followed
by the Wald test.

### Survival Curves from the Cox Model

We can take a look at the resulting group-specific curves:

```{r}

#| fig-cap: "Survival Functions for Three Groups by KM and Cox Model"

km_fit = survfit(Surv(t2, d3) ~ group, data = as.data.frame(bmt))

cox_fit = survfit(
  bmt.cox, 
  newdata = 
    data.frame(
      group = unique(bmt$group), 
      row.names = unique(bmt$group)))

library(survminer)

list(KM = km_fit, Cox = cox_fit) |> 
  survminer::ggsurvplot(
    # facet.by = "group",
    legend = "bottom", 
    legend.title = "",
    combine = TRUE, 
    fun = 'pct', 
    size = .5,
    ggtheme = theme_bw(), 
    conf.int = FALSE, 
    censor = FALSE) |> 
  suppressWarnings() # ggsurvplot() throws some warnings that aren't too worrying
```

When we use `survfit()` with a Cox model, we have to specify the covariate levels we are interested in; the argument `newdata` should include a `data.frame` with the same named columns as the predictors in the Cox model and one or more levels of each.

Otherwise (that is, if the `newdata` argument is missing), a curve is produced for a single "pseudo" subject with covariate values equal to the means component of the fit. 

The resulting curve(s) almost never make sense, but the default remains due to an unwarranted attachment to the
option shown by some users and by other packages.

Two particularly egregious examples are factor variables and
interactions. Suppose one were studying interspecies transmission of a virus, and the data set has a factor variable with levels ("pig", "chicken") and about equal numbers of observations for each. The "mean" covariate level will be 0.5 -- is this a flying pig?

### Examining `survfit`

```{r}
survfit(Surv(t2, d3)~group,data=bmt)
```

```{r}
survfit(Surv(t2, d3)~group,data=bmt) |> summary()
```

```{r}
survfit(bmt.cox)
survfit(bmt.cox, newdata = tibble(group = unique(bmt$group)))
```

```{r}
bmt.cox |> 
  survfit(newdata = tibble(group = unique(bmt$group))) |> 
  summary()
```

## Adjustment for Ties (optional)

###

At each time $t_i$ at which more than one of the subjects has an event,
let $d_i$ be the number of events at that time, $D_i$ the set of
subjects with events at that time, and let $s_i$ be a covariate vector
for an artificial subject obtained by adding up the covariate values for
the subjects with an event at time $t_i$. Let
$$\bar\eta_i = \beta_1s_{i1}+\cdots+\beta_ps_{ip}$$ and
$\bar\theta_i = \exp{\bar\eta_i}$.

Let $s_i$ be a covariate vector for an artificial subject obtained by
adding up the covariate values for the subjects with an event at time
$t_i$. Note that 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar\eta_i &=\sum_{j \in D_i}\beta_1x_{j1}+\cdots+\beta_px_{jp}\\
&= \beta_1s_{i1}+\cdots+\beta_ps_{ip}\\
\bar\theta_i &= \exp{\bar\eta_i}\\
&= \prod_{j \in D_i}\theta_i
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Breslow's method for ties

Breslow's method estimates the partial likelihood as

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(\beta|T) &=
\prod_i \frac{\bar\theta_i}{[\sum_{k \in R(t_i)} \theta_k]^{d_i}}\\
&= \prod_i \prod_{j \in D_i}\frac{\theta_j}{\sum_{k \in R(t_i)} \theta_k}
\end{aligned}
$$

This method is equivalent to treating each event as distinct and using the non-ties formula. 
It works best when the number of ties is small. 
It is the default in many statistical packages, including PROC PHREG in SAS.

#### Efron's method for ties

The other common method is Efron's, which is the default in R.

$$L(\beta|T)=
\prod_i \frac{\bar\theta_i}{\prod_{j=1}^{d_i}[\sum_{k \in R(t_i)} \theta_k-\frac{j-1}{d_i}\sum_{k \in D_i} \theta_k]}$$
This is closer to the exact discrete partial likelihood when there are
many ties.

The third option in R (and an option also in SAS as `discrete`) is the
"exact" method, which is the same one used for matched logistic
regression.

#### Example: Breslow's method

Suppose as an example we have a time $t$ where there are 20 individuals
at risk and three failures. Let the three individuals have risk
parameters $\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3$ and let the sum of the risk
parameters of the remaining 17 individuals be $\theta_R$. Then the
factor in the partial likelihood at time $t$ using Breslow's method is

::: smaller
$$
\left(\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_R+\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_R+\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_3}{\theta_R+\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
$$
:::

If on the other hand, they had died in the order 1,2, 3, then the
contribution to the partial likelihood would be:

::: smaller
$$
\left(\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_R+\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_R+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_3}{\theta_R+\theta_3}\right)
$$
:::

as the risk set got smaller with each failure. The exact method roughly
averages the results for the six possible orderings of the failures.

#### Example: Efron's method

But we don't know the order they failed in, so instead of reducing the
denominator by one risk coefficient each time, we reduce it by the same
fraction. This is Efron's method.

::: smaller
$$\left(\frac{\theta_1}{\theta_R+\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_2}{\theta_R+2(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3)/3}\right)
\left(\frac{\theta_3}{\theta_R+(\theta_1+\theta_2+\theta_3)/3}\right)$$
:::
