## Overview

### Time-to-event outcomes

**Survival analysis** is a framework for modeling *time-to-event* outcomes. It is used in:

-   clinical trials, where the event is often death or
    recurrence of disease.
-   engineering reliability analysis, where the event is
    failure of a device or system.
-   insurance, particularly life insurance, where the
    event is death.
    
:::{.callout-note}
The term *Survival analysis* is a bit misleading. Survival outcomes can sometimes be analyzed using binomial models (logistic regression). *Time-to-event models* might be a better name.
:::

## Time-to-event outcome distributions

### Distributions of Time-to-Event Data

-   The distribution of event times is asymmetric and can be
    long-tailed, and starts at 0 (that is, $P(T<0) = 0$).
-   The base distribution is not normal, but exponential.
-   There are usually **censored** observations, which are ones in which
    the failure time is not observed.
-   Often, these are **right-censored**, meaning that we know that the
    event occurred after some known time $t$, but we don't know the
    actual event time, as when a patient is still alive at the end of
    the study.
-   Observations can also be **left-censored**, meaning we know the
    event has already happened at time $t$, or **interval-censored**,
    meaning that we only know that the event happened between times
    $t_1$ and $t_2$.
-   Analysis is difficult if censoring is associated with treatment.

### Right Censoring

-   Patients are in a clinical trial for cancer, some on a new treatment
    and some on standard of care.
-   Some patients in each group have died by the end of the study. We
    know the survival time (measured for example from time of
    diagnosis---each person on their own clock).
-   Patients still alive at the end of the study are right censored.
-   Patients who are lost to follow-up or withdraw from the study may be
    right-censored.

### Left and Interval Censoring

-   An individual tests positive for HIV.
-   If the event is infection with HIV, then we only know that it has
    occurred before the testing time $t$, so this is left censored.
-   If an individual has a negative HIV test at time $t_1$ and a
    positive HIV test at time $t_2$, then the infection event is
    interval censored.

## Distribution functions for time-to-event variables

### The Probability Density Function (PDF)

For a time-to-event variable $T$ with a continuous distribution, the
**probability density function** is defined as usual:

$$f(t)\eqdef  p(t) \eqdef  p(T=t)$$

Typically, this density is assumed to be 0 for all $t<0$; that is,
$f(t) = 0, \forall t<0$. In other words, the range of $T$ is typically
$[0,\infty)$.

:::{#exm-exp-pdf}
#### exponential distribution

Recall from Epi 202: the pdf of the exponential distribution family of
models is:

$$p(T=t) = \mathbb{1}_{t \ge 0}\cdot \lambda  \text{e}^{-\lambda t}$$ 

where $\lambda > 0$.

Here are some examples of exponential pdfs:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "0.5"),
    fun = \(x) dexp(x, rate = 0.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1"),
    fun = \(x) dexp(x, rate = 1)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1.5"),
    fun = \(x) dexp(x, rate = 1.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 5"),
    fun = \(x) dexp(x, rate = 5)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("p(T=t)") +
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = expr(lambda))) +
  xlab("Time (t)") +
  xlim(0, 2.5) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1),
    axis.title.y = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1))
```

:::

### The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The **cumulative distribution function** is defined as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F(t) &\eqdef \Pr(T \le t)\\
&=\int_{u=0}^t f(u) du
\end{aligned}
$$

:::{#exm-exp-cdf}
##### exponential distribution

Recall from Epi 202: the cdf of the exponential distribution family of
models is:

$$
P(T\le t) = \mathbb{1}_{t \ge 0}\cdot(1- \text{e}^{-\lambda t})
$$ where $\lambda > 0$.

Here are some examples of exponential cdfs:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "0.5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, rate = 0.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, rate = 1)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1.5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, rate = 1.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, rate = 5)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("p(T<=t)") +
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = expr(lambda))) +
  xlab("Time (t)") +
  xlim(0, 2.5) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1),
    axis.title.y = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1))
```

:::

### The Survival Function

For survival data, a more important quantity is the **survival
function**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(t) &\eqdef \Pr(T > t)\\
&=\int_{u=t}^\infty p(u) du\\
&=1-F(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The survival function $S(t)$ is the probability that the event time is
later than $t$. If the event in a clinical trial is death, then $S(t)$ is
the expected fraction of the original population at time 0 who have survived up to time $t$ and are still alive at time $t$; that is, if $X_t$ represents survival status at time $t$, with $X_t = 1$ denoting alive at time $t$ and $X_t = 0$ denoting deceased at time $t$, then:

$$S(t) = \E{X_t}$$

:::{#exm-exp-survfn}
##### exponential distribution

Since $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$, the survival function of the exponential
distribution family of models is:

$$
P(T> t) = \left\{ {{\text{e}^{-\lambda t}, t\ge0} \atop {1, t \le 0}}\right. 
$$ where $\lambda > 0$.

Here are some examples of exponential pdfs:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "0.5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, lower = FALSE, rate = 0.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, lower = FALSE, rate = 1)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 1.5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, lower = FALSE, rate = 1.5)) +
  geom_function(
    aes(col = "p = 5"),
    fun = \(x) pexp(x, lower = FALSE, rate = 5)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("p(T<=t)") +
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = expr(lambda))) +
  xlab("Time (t)") +
  xlim(0, 2.5) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1),
    axis.title.y = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1))
```

:::

### The Hazard Function

Another important quantity is the **hazard function**:

:::{#def-hazard}

{{< include _def-hazard.qmd >}}

:::

The hazard function has an important relationship to the density and survival functions, which we can use to derive the hazard function for a given probability distribution.

:::{#thm-hazard1}

$$h(t)=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$

::::{.proof}


:::::{#lem-joint-prob-same-var}

#### Joint probability of a variable with itself

$$p(T=t, T\ge t) = p(T=t)$$

::::::{.proof}
Recall from Epi 202: if $A$ and $B$ are statistical events and $A\subseteq B$, then $p(A, B) = p(A)$. In particular, $\{T=t\} \subseteq \{T\geq t\}$, so $p(T=t, T\ge t) = p(T=t)$.
::::::
:::::
Hence:

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t) &=p(T=t|T\ge t)\\
&=\frac{p(T=t, T\ge t)}{p(T \ge t)}\\
&=\frac{p(T=t)}{p(T \ge t)}\\
&=\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{aligned}
$$

::::

:::

:::{#exm-exp-haz}
##### exponential distribution

The hazard function of the exponential distribution family of models is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(T=t|T \ge t) 
&= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\
&= \frac{\mathbb{1}_{t \ge 0}\cdot \lambda  \text{e}^{-\lambda t}}{\text{e}^{-\lambda t}}\\
&=\mathbb{1}_{t \ge 0}\cdot \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

@fig-exp-hazard shows some examples of exponential hazard functions:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Examples of hazard functions for exponential distributions"
#| label: fig-exp-hazard
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_hline(
    aes(col = "0.5",yintercept = 0.5)) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(col = "p = 1", yintercept = 1)) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(col = "p = 1.5", yintercept = 1.5)) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(col = "p = 5", yintercept = 5)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("p(T=t | T<=t)") +
  ylim(0,5) +
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = expr(lambda))) +
  xlab("Time (t)") +
  xlim(0, 2.5) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1),
    axis.title.y = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1))
```

:::

We can also view the hazard function as the derivative of the negative of the logarithm of the survival function:

:::{#thm-h-logS}

$$h(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\cb{-\log{S(t)}}$$

::::{.proof}
$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t)
&= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\
&= \frac{-S'(t)}{S(t)}\\
&= -\frac{S'(t)}{S(t)}\\
&=-\frac{d}{dt}\log{S(t)}\\
&=\frac{d}{dt}\cb{-\log{S(t)}}
\end{aligned}
$$
::::
:::

### The Cumulative Hazard Function

Since $h(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\cb{-\log{S(t)}}$ (see @thm-h-logS), we also have:

:::{#cor-surv-int-haz}
$$S(t) = \exp{-\int_{u=0}^t h(u)du}$${#eq-surv-int-haz}
:::

The integral in @eq-surv-int-haz is important enough to have its own name: **cumulative hazard**.

:::{#def-cumhaz}

##### cumulative hazard

The **cumulative hazard function** $H(t)$ is defined as:

$$H(t) \eqdef \int_{u=0}^t h(u) du$$

:::

As we will see below, $H(t)$ is tractable to estimate, and we can then
derive an estimate of the hazard function using an approximate derivative
of the estimated cumulative hazard.

:::{#exm-exp-cumhaz}

The cumulative hazard function of the exponential distribution family of
models is:

$$
H(t) = \mathbb{1}_{t \ge 0}\cdot \lambda t
$$

Here are some examples of exponential cumulative hazard functions:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_abline(
    aes(col = "0.5",intercept = 0, slope = 0.5)) +
  geom_abline(
    aes(col = "p = 1", intercept = 0, slope = 1)) +
  geom_abline(
    aes(col = "p = 1.5", intercept = 0, slope = 1.5)) +
  geom_abline(
    aes(col = "p = 5", intercept = 0, slope = 5)) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("H(t)") +
  ylim(0,5) +
  guides(col = guide_legend(title = expr(lambda))) +
  xlab("Time (t)") +
  xlim(0, 2.5) +
  theme(
    axis.title.x = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1),
    axis.title.y = 
      element_text(
        angle = 0, 
        vjust = 1, 
        hjust = 1))
```

### Some Key Mathematical Relationships among Survival Concepts

Diagram:

$$
h(t) \xrightarrow[]{\int_{u=0}^t h(u)du} H(t) 
\xrightarrow[]{\exp{-H(t)}} S(t)
\xrightarrow[]{1-S(t)} F(t)
$$

$$
h(t) \xleftarrow[\frac{d}{dt}H(t)]{} H(t) 
\xleftarrow[-\log{S(t)}]{} S(t)
\xleftarrow[1-F(t)]{} F(t)
$$


Identities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
S(t) &= 1 - F(t)\\
&= \text{exp}\left\{-H(t)\right\}\\
S'(t) &= -f(t)\\
H(t) &= -\text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}\\
H'(t) &= h(t)\\
h(t) &= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\
 &= -\frac{d}{dt}\log{S(t)} \\
f(t) &= h(t)\cdot S(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

::: {.content-visible unless-format="revealjs"}
Some proofs (others left as exercises):

$$
\begin{aligned}
S'(t) &= \frac{d}{dt}(1-F(t))\\
&= -F'(t)\\
&= -f(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{d}{dt}\log{S(t)} 
&= \frac{S'(t)}{S(t)}\\
&= -\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}\\
&= -h(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
H(t)
&\eqdef \int_{u=0}^t h(u) du\\
&= \int_0^t -\frac{d}{du}\text{log}\left\{S(u)\right\} du\\
&= \left[-\text{log}\left\{S(u)\right\}\right]_{u=0}^{u=t}\\
&= \left[\text{log}\left\{S(u)\right\}\right]_{u=t}^{u=0}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{S(0)\right\} - \text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{1\right\} - \text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}\\
&= 0 - \text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}\\
&=-\text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

Equivalently:

$$S(t) = \text{exp}\left\{-H(t)\right\}$$

#### Likelihood with censoring \*

::: callout-note
This subsection was not presented in class in 2023; it is not necessary
to understand for the qualifying exam.
:::

If an event time $T$ is observed exactly as $T=t$, then the likelihood
of that observation is just its probability density function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L(t) 
&= p(T=t)\\ 
&\eqdef  f_T(t)\\
&= h_T(t)S_T(t)\\
\ell(t) 
&\eqdef \text{log}\left\{\mathcal L(t)\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{h_T(t)S_T(t)\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{h_T(t)\right\} + \text{log}\left\{S_T(t)\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{h_T(t)\right\} - H_T(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

If instead the event time $T$ is censored and only known to be after
time $y$, then the likelihood of that censored observation is instead
the survival function evaluated at the censoring time:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L(y) 
&=p_T(T>y)\\
&\eqdef  S_T(y)\\
\ell(y)
&\eqdef \text{log}\left\{\mathcal L(y)\right\}\\
&=\text{log}\left\{S(y)\right\}\\
&=-H(y)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

What's written above is incomplete. We also observed whether or not the
observation was censored. Let $C$ denote the time when censoring would
occur (if the event did not occur first); let $f_C(y)$ and $S_C(y)$ be
the corresponding density and survival functions for the censoring
event.

Let $Y$ denote the time when observation ended (either by censoring or
by the event of interest occurring), and let $D$ be an indicator
variable for the event occurring at $Y$ (so $D=0$ represents a censored
observation and $D=1$ represents an uncensored observation). In other
words, let $Y \eqdef  \min(T,C)$ and
$D \eqdef  \mathbb 1{\{T<=C\}}$.

Then the complete likelihood of the observed data $(Y,D)$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L(y,d) 
&= p(Y=y, D=d)\\
&= \left[p(T=y,C> y)\right]^d \cdot 
\left[p(T>y,C=y)\right]^{1-d}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Typically, survival analyses assume that $C$ and $T$ are mutually
independent; this assumption is called "non-informative" censoring.

Then the joint likelihood $p(Y,D)$ factors into the product
$p(Y), p(D)$, and the likelihood reduces to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L(y,d) 
&= \left[p(T=y,C> y)\right]^d\cdot 
\left[p(T>y,C=y)\right]^{1-d}\\
&= \left[p(T=y)p(C> y)\right]^d\cdot 
\left[p(T>y)p(C=y)\right]^{1-d}\\
&= \left[f_T(y)S_C(y)\right]^d\cdot 
\left[S(y)f_C(y)\right]^{1-d}\\
&= \left[f_T(y)^d S_C(y)^d\right]\cdot 
\left[S_T(y)^{1-d}f_C(y)^{1-d}\right]\\
&= \left(f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}\right)\cdot 
\left(f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

The corresponding log-likelihood is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell(y,d) 
&= \text{log}\left\{\mathcal L(y,d) \right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{
\left(f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}\right)\cdot 
\left(f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}\right)
\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\} 
+
\text{log}\left\{
f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}
\right\}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ Let

-   $\theta_T$ represent the parameters of $p_T(t)$,
-   $\theta_C$ represent the parameters of $p_C(c)$,
-   $\theta = (\theta_T, \theta_C)$ be the combined vector of all
    parameters.

Then corresponding score function is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell'(y,d) 
&= \frac{d}{d\theta} 
\left[
\text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\} 
+
\text{log}\left\{
f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}
\right\}
\right]\\
&= 
\left(
\frac{d}{d\theta} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\}
\right)
+
\left(
\frac{d}{d\theta} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}
\right\}
\right)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

As long as $\theta_C$ and $\theta_T$ don't share any parameters, then if
censoring is non-informative, the partial derivative with respect to
$\theta_T$ is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell'_{\theta_T}(y,d)
&\eqdef  \frac{d}{d\theta_T}\ell(y,d)\\
&= 
\left(
\frac{d}{d\theta_T} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\}
\right)
+
\left(
\frac{d}{d\theta_T} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_C(y)^{1-d} \cdot S_C(y)^{d}
\right\}
\right)\\
&= 
\left(
\frac{d}{d\theta_T} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\}
\right) + 0\\
&= 
\frac{d}{d\theta_T} 
\text{log}\left\{
f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}
\right\}\\
\end{aligned}
$$ Thus, the MLE for $\theta_T$ won't depend on $\theta_C$, and we can
ignore the distribution of $C$ when estimating the parameters of
$f_T(t)=p(T=t)$.

Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L(y,d) 
&= f_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}\\
&= \left(h_T(y)^d  S_T(y)^d\right) \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}\\
&= h_T(y)^d  \cdot S_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)^{1-d}\\
&= h_T(y)^d \cdot S_T(y)\\
&= S_T(y) \cdot h_T(y)^d \\
\end{aligned}
$$

That is, if the event occurred at time $y$ (i.e., if $d=1$), then the
likelihood of $(Y,D) = (y,d)$ is equal to the hazard function at $y$
times the survival function at $y$. Otherwise, the likelihood is equal
to just the survival function at $y$.

The corresponding log-likelihood is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell(y,d)
&=\text{log}\left\{\mathcal L(y,d)\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{S_T(y) \cdot h_T(y)^d\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{S_T(y)\right\} + \text{log}\left\{h_T(y)^d\right\}\\
&= \text{log}\left\{S_T(y)\right\} + d\cdot \text{log}\left\{h_T(y)\right\}\\
&= -H_T(y) + d\cdot \text{log}\left\{h_T(y)\right\}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, the log-likelihood contribution from a single
observation $(Y,D) = (y,d)$ is equal to the negative cumulative hazard
at $y$, plus the log of the hazard at $y$ if the event occurred at time
$y$.

## Parametric Models for Time-to-Event Outcomes

### Exponential Distribution

-   The exponential distribution is the base distribution for survival
    analysis.
-   The distribution has a constant hazard $\lambda$
-   The mean survival time is $\lambda^{-1}$

#### Mathematical details of exponential distribution

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(t) &= \lambda \text{e}^{-\lambda t}\\
E(t) &= \lambda^{-1}\\
Var(t) &= \lambda^{-2}\\
F(t) &= 1-\text{e}^{-\lambda x}\\
S(t)&= \text{e}^{-\lambda x}\\
\ln(S(t))&=-\lambda x\\
h(t) &= -\frac{f(t)}{S(t)} = -\frac{\lambda \text{e}^{-\lambda t}}{\text{e}^{-\lambda t}}=\lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Estimation of $\lambda$

-   Suppose we have $m$ exponential survival times of
    $t_1, t_2,\ldots,t_m$ and $k$ right-censored values at
    $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k$.

-   A survival time of $t_i=10$ means that subject $i$ died at time 10.
    A right-censored time $u_i=10$ means that at time 10, subject $i$
    was still alive and that we have no further follow-up.

-   For the moment we will assume that the survival distribution is
    exponential and that all the subjects have the same parameter
    $\lambda$.

We have $m$ exponential survival times of $t_1, t_2,\ldots,t_m$ and $k$
right-censored values at $u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_k$. The log-likelihood of an
observed survival time $t_i$ is $$
\text{log}\left\{\lambda \text{e}^{-\lambda t_i}\right\} =
\text{log}\left\{\lambda\right\}-\lambda t_i
$$ and the likelihood of a censored value is the probability of that
outcome (survival greater than $u_j$) so the log-likelihood is $$
\text{log}\left\{\lambda \text{e}^{u_j}\right\} =-\lambda u_j.
$$

Let $T=\sum t_i$ and $U=\sum u_j$. Then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\ell(\lambda) &= \sum_{i=1}^m( \ln \lambda-\lambda t_i) + \sum_{j=1}^k (-\lambda u_j)\\
&= m \ln \lambda -(T+U)\lambda\\
\ell'(\lambda) 
&=m\lambda^{-1} -(T+U)\\
\hat{\lambda} &= \frac{m}{T+U}\\
\ell''&=-m/\lambda^2\\
&< 0\\
\hat E[T] &= \hat\lambda^{-1}\\
&= \frac{T+U}{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Fisher Information and Standard Error

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[-\ell'']
& = m/\lambda^2\\
\text{Var}\left(\hat\lambda\right) 
&\approx \left(E[-\ell'']\right)^{-1}\\
&=\lambda^2/m\\
\text{SE}\left(\hat\lambda\right) 
&= \sqrt{\text{Var}\left(\hat\lambda\right)}\\
&\approx \lambda/\sqrt{m}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\hat\lambda$ depends on the censoring times of the censored
observations, but $\text{Var}\left(\hat\lambda\right)$ only depends on
the number of uncensored observations, $m$, and not on the number of
censored observations ($k$).

#### Other Parametric Survival Distributions

-   Any density on $[0,\infty)$ can be a survival distribution, but the
    most useful ones are all skew right.
-   The commonest generalization of the exponential is the Weibull.
-   Other common choices are the gamma, log-normal, log-logistic,
    Gompertz, inverse Gaussian, and Pareto.
-   Most of what we do going forward is non-parametric or
    semi-parametric, but sometimes these parametric distributions
    provide a useful approach.

### Weibull Distribution

$$
\begin{aligned}
p(t)&= \alpha\lambda x^{\alpha-1}\text{e}^{-\lambda x^\alpha}\\
h(t)&=\alpha\lambda x^{\alpha-1}\\
S(t)&=\text{e}^{-\lambda x^\alpha}\\
E(T)&= \Gamma(1+1/\alpha)\cdot \lambda^{-1/\alpha}
\end{aligned}
$$

When $\alpha=1$ this is the exponential. When $\alpha>1$ the hazard is
increasing and when $\alpha < 1$ the hazard is decreasing. This provides
more flexibility than the exponential.

We will see more of this distribution later.

## Nonparametric Survival Analysis

### Basic ideas

-   Mostly, we work without a parametric model.

-   The first task is to estimate a survival function from data listing
    survival times, and censoring times for censored data.

-   For example one patient may have relapsed at 10 months. Another
    might have been followed for 32 months without a relapse having
    occurred (censored).

-   The minimum information we need for each patient is a time and a
    censoring variable which is 1 if the event occurred at the indicated
    time and 0 if this is a censoring time.

## Example: clinical trial for pediatric acute leukemia

### Overview of study

This is from a clinical trial in 1963 for 6-MP treatment vs. placebo for
Acute Leukemia in 42 children.

-   Pairs of children:

    -   matched by remission status at the time of treatment (`remstat`:
        `1` = partial, `2` = complete)
    -   randomized to 6-MP (exit times in `t2`) or placebo (exit times
        in `t1`)

-   Followed until relapse or end of study.

-   All of the placebo group relapsed, but some of the 6-MP group were
    censored (which means they were still in remission); indicated by
    `relapse` variable (`0` = censored, `1` = relapse).

-   6-MP = 6-Mercaptopurine (Purinethol) is an anti-cancer
    ("antineoplastic" or "cytotoxic") chemotherapy drug used currently
    for Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is classified as an
    antimetabolite.

### Study design {.smaller}

Clinical trial in 1963 for 6-MP treatment vs. placebo for Acute Leukemia
in 42 children. Pairs of children matched by remission status at the
time of treatment (1 = partial or 2 = complete) and randomized to 6-MP
or placebo. Followed until relapse or end of study. All of the placebo
group relapsed, but some of the 6-MP group were censored.

```{r}
library(KMsurv)
data(drug6mp)
drug6mp |> tibble() |> print()
```

### Data documentation for `drug6mp`

```{r, printr.help.sections = c("description", "format")}
library(printr) # inserts help-file output into markdown output
library(KMsurv)
?drug6mp
```

### Descriptive Statistics

-   The average time in each group is not useful. Some of the 6-MP
    patients have not relapsed at the time recorded, while all of the
    placebo patients have relapsed.
-   The median time is not really useful either because so many of the
    6-MP patients have not relapsed (12/21).
-   Both are biased down in the 6-MP group. Remember that lower times
    are worse since they indicate sooner recurrence.
-   We can compute the average hazard rate, which is the estimate of the
    exponential parameter: number of relapses divided by the sum of the
    times.
-   For the placebo, that is just the reciprocal of the mean time =
    1/8.667 = 0.115.
-   For the 6-MP group this is 9/359 = 0.025
-   The estimated average hazard in the placebo group is 4.6 times as
    large (if the hazard is constant over time).

## The Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator

-   The estimated survival function for the placebo patients is easy to
    compute. For any time $t$ in months, $S(t)$ is the fraction of
    patients with times greater than $t$.

-   For the 6-MP patients, we cannot ignore the censored data because we
    know that the time to relapse is greater than the censoring time.

-   For any time $t$ in months, we know that 6-MP patients with times
    greater than $t$ have not relapsed, and those with relapse time less
    than $t$ have relapsed, but we don't know if patients with censored
    time less than $t$ have relapsed or not.

-   The procedure we usually use is the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
    estimator of the survival function.

-   The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a step function (like the empirical
    cdf), which changes value only at the event times, not at the
    censoring times.

-   At each event time $t$, we compute the at-risk group size $Y$, which
    is all those observations whose event time or censoring time is at
    least $t$.

-   If $d$ of the observations have an event time (not a censoring time)
    of $t$, then the group of survivors immediately following time $t$
    is reduced by the fraction $$\frac{Y-d}{Y}=1-\frac{d}{Y}$$

If the event times are $t_i$ with events per time of $d_i$
($1\le i \le k$), then $$\hat S(t) = \prod_{t_i < t}[1-d_i/Y_i]$$ where
$Y_i$ is the set of observations whose time (event or censored) is
$\ge t_i$, the group at risk at time $t_i$.

If there are no censored data, and there are $n$ data points, then just
after (say) the third event time $$
\begin{aligned}
\hat S(t) 
&= \prod_{t_i < t}[1-d_i/Y_i]\\
&=[\frac{n-d_1}{n}][\frac{n-d_1-d_2}{n-d_1}][\frac{n-d_1-d_2-d_3}{n-d_1-d_2}]\\
&=\frac{n-d_1-d_2-d_3}{n}\\
&=1-\frac{d_1+d_2+d_3}{n}\\
&=1-\hat F(t)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\hat F(t)$ is the usual empirical CDF estimate.

### Kaplan-Meier curve for `drug6mp` data

Here is the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curve for the patients who
received 6-MP in the `drug6mp` dataset (we will see code to produce
figures like this one shortly):

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve for 6-MP Patients"

require(KMsurv)
data(drug6mp)

library(survival)
drug6mp_km_model1 = 
  drug6mp |> 
  mutate(surv = Surv(t2, relapse)) |> 
  survfit(formula = surv ~ 1, data = _)

library(ggfortify)
drug6mp_km_model1 |>  
  autoplot(
    mark.time = TRUE,
    conf.int = FALSE) +
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  xlab('Time since diagnosis (months)') +
  ylab("KM Survival Curve")

```

### Kaplan-Meier calculations {.smaller}

Let's compute these estimates and build the chart by hand:

```{r}
library(KMsurv)
library(dplyr)
data(drug6mp)

drug6mp.v2 = 
  drug6mp |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    remstat = remstat |> 
      case_match(
        1 ~ "partial",
        2 ~ "complete"
      ),
    # renaming to "outcome" while relabeling is just a style choice:
    outcome = relapse |> 
      case_match(
        0 ~ "censored",
        1 ~ "relapsed"
      )
  )

km.6mp =
  drug6mp.v2 |> 
  summarize(
    .by = t2,
    Relapses = sum(outcome == "relapsed"),
    Censored = sum(outcome == "censored")) |>
  # here we add a start time row, so the graph starts at time 0:
  bind_rows(
    tibble(
      t2 = 0, 
      Relapses = 0, 
      Censored = 0)
  ) |> 
  # sort in time order:
  arrange(t2) |>
  mutate(
    Exiting = Relapses + Censored,
    `Study Size` = sum(Exiting),
    Exited = cumsum(Exiting) |> dplyr::lag(default = 0),
    `At Risk` = `Study Size` - Exited,
    Hazard = Relapses / `At Risk`,
    `KM Factor` = 1 - Hazard,
    `Cumulative Hazard` = cumsum(`Hazard`),
    `KM Survival Curve` = cumprod(`KM Factor`)
  )

library(pander)  
pander(km.6mp)
```

#### Summary

For the 6-MP patients at time 6 months, there are 21 patients at risk.
At $t=6$ there are 3 relapses and 1 censored observations.

The Kaplan-Meier factor is $(21-3)/21 = 0.857$. The number at risk for
the next time ($t=7$) is $21-3-1=17$.

At time 7 months, there are 17 patients at risk. At $t=7$ there is 1
relapse and 0 censored observations. The Kaplan-Meier factor is
$(17-1)/17 = 0.941$. The Kaplan Meier estimate is
$0.857\times0.941=0.807$. The number at risk for the next time ($t=9$)
is $17-1=16$.

Now, let's graph this estimated survival curve using `ggplot()`:

```{r "estimated survival curve"}
library(ggplot2)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
km.6mp |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = t2, y = `KM Survival Curve`)) +
  geom_step() +
  geom_point(data = km.6mp |> filter(Censored > 0), shape = 3) +
  expand_limits(y = c(0,1), x = 0) +
  xlab('Time since diagnosis (months)') +
  ylab("KM Survival Curve") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

## Using the `survival` package in R

We don't have to do these calculations by hand every time; the
`survival` package and several others have functions available to
automate many of these tasks (full list:
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Survival.html>).

### The `Surv` function

To use the `survival` package, the first step is telling R how to
combine the exit time and exit reason (censoring versus event) columns.
The `Surv()` function accomplishes this task.

#### Example: `Surv()` with `drug6mp` data

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| code-line-numbers: "5-7"
library(survival)
drug6mp.v3 = 
  drug6mp.v2 |> 
  mutate(
    surv2 = Surv(
      time = t2,
      event = (outcome == "relapsed")))

print(drug6mp.v3)

```

The output of `Surv()` is a vector of objects with class `Surv`. When we
print this vector:

-   observations where the event was observed are printed as the event
    time (for example, `surv2 = 10` on line 1)

-   observations where the event was right-censored are printed as the
    censoring time with a plus sign (`+`; for example, `surv2 = 32+` on
    line 3).

### The `survfit` function

Once we have constructed our `Surv` variable, we can calculate the
Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival curve using the `survfit()`
function.

::: callout-note
The documentation for `?survfit` isn't too helpful; the
`survfit.formula` documentation is better.

```{r, printr.help.sections = c("description", "usage")}
#| include: false
?survfit.formula
```
:::

#### Example: `survfit()` with `drug6mp` data

Here we use `survfit()` to create a `survfit` object, which contains the
Kaplan-Meier estimate:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
drug6mp.km_model = survfit(
  formula = surv2 ~ 1, 
  data = drug6mp.v3)
```

`print.survfit()` just gives some summary statistics:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
print(drug6mp.km_model)
```

`summary.survfit()` shows us the underlying Kaplan-Meier table:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
summary(drug6mp.km_model)
```

`summary.survfit()` shows us the underlying Kaplan-Meier table:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
summary(drug6mp.km_model)
```

We can specify which time points we want using the `times` argument:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
summary(
  drug6mp.km_model, 
  times = c(0, drug6mp.v3$t2))

```

```{r, printr.help.sections = c("description", "usage", "arguments")}
#| code-fold: show
?summary.survfit
```

### Plotting estimated survival functions

We can plot `survfit` objects with `plot()`, `autoplot()`, or
`ggsurvplot()`:

```{r}
#| code-fold: show
#| fig-cap: "Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve for 6-MP Patients"

library(ggfortify)
autoplot(drug6mp.km_model)

# not shown:
# plot(drug6mp.km_model)

# library(survminer)
# ggsurvplot(drug6mp.km_model)

```

#### quantiles of survival curve

We can extract quantiles with `quantile()`:

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "2"
drug6mp.km_model |> 
  quantile(p = c(.25, .5)) |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(p = c(.25, .5)) |> 
  relocate(p, .before = everything())
```

### Two-sample tests

#### The `survdiff` function

```{r, printr.help.sections = c("description", "usage")}
?survdiff
```

#### Example: `survdiff()` with `drug6mp` data

Now we are going to compare the placebo and 6-MP data. We need to
reshape the data to make it usable with the standard `survival`
workflow:

```{r}
library(survival)

drug6mp.v4 = 
  drug6mp.v3 |>
  select(pair, remstat, t1, t2, outcome) |> 
  # here we are going to change the data from a wide format to long:
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(t1, t2),
    names_to = "treatment",
    values_to = "exit_time") |> 
  mutate(
    treatment = treatment |> 
      case_match(
        "t1" ~ "placebo",
        "t2" ~ "6-MP"
      ),
    outcome = if_else(
      treatment == "placebo",
      "relapsed",
      outcome
    ),
    surv = Surv(
      time = exit_time,
      event = (outcome == "relapsed"))
  )
```

Using this long data format, we can fit a Kaplan-Meier curve for each
treatment group simultaneously:

```{r}
drug6mp.km_model2 = 
   survfit(
  formula = surv ~ treatment, 
  data = drug6mp.v4)
```

We can plot the curves in the same graph:

```{r}
drug6mp.km_model2 |> autoplot()
```

We can also perform something like a t-test, where the null hypothesis
is that the curves are the same:

```{r}
survdiff(
  formula = surv ~ treatment,
  data = drug6mp.v4)
```

By default, `survdiff()` ignores any pairing, but we can use `strata()`
to perform something similar to a paired t-test:

```{r}
survdiff(
  formula = surv ~ treatment + strata(pair),
  data = drug6mp.v4)

```

Interestingly, accounting for pairing reduces the significant of the
difference.

## Example: Bone Marrow Transplant Data

(Copelan et al., 1991)

##### Treatment {.unnumbered}

-   **allogeneic** (from a donor) **bone marrow transplant therapy**

##### Inclusion criteria {.unnumbered}

-   **acute myeloid leukemia (AML)**
-   **acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).**

##### Possible intermediate events {.unnumbered}

-   **graft vs. host disease (GVHD)**: an immunological rejection
    response to the transplant
-   **platelet recovery**: a return of platelet count to normal levels.

One or the other, both in either order, or neither may occur.

##### End point events

-   relapse of the disease
-   death

Any or all of these events may be censored.

### `KMsurv::bmt` data in R

```{r}
library(printr) # inserts help-file output into markdown output
library(KMsurv)
?bmt
```

### Analysis plan

-   We concentrate for now on disease-free survival (`t2` and `d3`) for
    the three risk groups, ALL, AML Low Risk, and AML High Risk.
-   We will construct the Kaplan-Meier survival curves, compare them,
    and test for differences.
-   We will construct the cumulative hazard curves and compare them.
-   We will estimate the hazard functions, interpret, and compare them.

### Survival Function Estimate and Variance

$$\hat S(t) = \prod_{t_i < t}\left[1-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right]$$ where
$Y_i$ is the group at risk at time $t_i$.

The estimated variance of $\hat S(t)$ is (Greenwood's formula)
$$\hat{\text{Var}}\left(\hat S (t)\right) = \hat S(t)^2\sum_{t_i <t}\frac{d_i}{Y_i(Y_i-d_i)}$$
which we can use for confidence intervals for a survival function or a
difference of survival functions.

##### Kaplan-Meier survival curves

```{r}
#| code-summary: "code to preprocess and model bmt data"
library(KMsurv)
library(survival)
data(bmt)

bmt = 
  bmt |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  mutate(
    group = 
      group |> 
      factor(
        labels = c("ALL","Low Risk AML","High Risk AML")),
    surv = Surv(t2,d3))

km_model1 = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ group, 
  data = bmt)
```

```{r "KM survival curves for bmt data"}
#| fig-cap: "Disease-Free Survival by Disease Group"

library(ggfortify)
autoplot(
  km_model1, 
  conf.int = TRUE,
  ylab = "Pr(disease-free survival)",
  xlab = "Time since transplant (days)") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

```

#### Understanding Greenwood's formula (optional)

To see where Greenwood's formula comes from, let $x_i=Y_i-d_i$. We
approximate the solution treating each time as independent, with $Y_i$
fixed and ignore randomness in times of failure and we treat $x_i$ as
independent binomials $\text{Bin}(Y_i,p_i)$. Letting $S(t)$ be the
"true" survival function

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat S(t) &=\prod_{t_i<t}x_i/Y_i\\
S(t)&=\prod_{t_i<t}p_i
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\hat S(t)}{S(t)} 
&= \prod_{t_i<t} \frac{x_i}{p_iY_i}=\prod_{t_i<t} \frac{\hat p_i}{p_i}\\
&=\prod_{t_i<t} \left( 1+\frac{\hat p_i-p_i}{p_i} \right)\\
&\approx 1+\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{\hat p_i-p_i}{p_i} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Var}\left(\frac{\hat S(t)}{S(t)}\right) 
&\approx \text{Var}\left(1+\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{\hat p_i-p_i}{p_i}\right) \\
&=\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{1}{p_i^2}\frac{p_i(1-p_i)}{Y_i} \\
&= \sum_{t_i<t} \frac{(1-p_i)}{p_iY_i}
\approx\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{(1-x_i/Y_i)}{x_i}\\
&=\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{Y_i-x_i}{x_iY_i}=\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{d_i}{Y_i(Y_i-d_i)}\\
\text{Var}\left(\hat S(t)\right)
&\approx \hat S(t)^2\sum_{t_i<t} \frac{d_i}{Y_i(Y_i-d_i)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Test for differences among the disease groups

Here we compute a chi-square test for assocation between disease group
(`group`) and disease-free survival:

```{r}
survdiff(surv ~ group, data = bmt)
```

### Cumulative Hazard

$$
\begin{aligned}
h(t) 
&\eqdef   P(T=t|T\ge t)\\
&= \frac{p(T=t)}{P(T\ge t)}\\
&= -\frac{d}{dt}\text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}
\end{aligned}
$$

The **cumulative hazard** (or **integrated hazard**) function is

$$H(t)\eqdef  \int_0^t h(t) dt$$ Since
$h(t) = -\frac{d}{dt}\text{log}\left\{S(t)\right\}$ as shown above, we
have:

$$
H(t)=-\text{log}\left\{S\right\}(t)
$$

So we can estimate $H(t)$ as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat H(t) 
&= -\text{log}\left\{\hat S(t)\right\}\\
&= -\text{log}\left\{\prod_{t_i < t}\left[1-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right]\right\}\\
&= -\sum_{t_i < t}\text{log}\left\{1-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right\}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

This is the **Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) estimate of cumulative
hazard**.

#### Example: Cumulative Hazard Curves for Bone-Marrow Transplant (`bmt`) data

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Disease-Free Cumulative Hazard by Disease Group"

autoplot(
  fun = "cumhaz",
  km_model1, 
  conf.int = FALSE,
  ylab = "Cumulative hazard (disease-free survival)",
  xlab = "Time since transplant (days)") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

## Nelson-Aalen Estimates of Cumulative Hazard and Survival

The point hazard at time $t_i$ can be estimated by $d_i/Y_i$, which
leads to the **Nelson-Aalen estimator of the cumulative hazard**:

$$\hat H_{NA}(t) \eqdef \sum_{t_i < t}\frac{d_i}{Y_i}$$

The variance of this estimator is approximately: $$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\text{Var}}\left(\hat H_{NA} (t)\right) 
&= \sum_{t_i <t}\frac{(d_i/Y_i)(1-d_i/Y_i)}{Y_i}\\
&\approx \sum_{t_i <t}\frac{d_i}{Y_i^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since $S(t)=\text{exp}\left\{-H(t)\right\}$, the Nelson-Aalen cumulative
hazard estimate can be converted into an alternate estimate of the
survival function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat S_{NA}(t)
&= \text{exp}\left\{-\hat H_{NA}(t)\right\}\\
&= \text{exp}\left\{-\sum_{t_i < t}\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right\}\\
&= \prod_{t_i < t}\text{exp}\left\{-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right\}\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Compare these with the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimates:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat H_{KM}(t) &= -\sum_{t_i < t}\text{log}\left\{1-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right\}\\
\hat S_{KM}(t) &= \prod_{t_i < t}\left[1-\frac{d_i}{Y_i}\right]
\end{aligned}
$$

The product limit estimate and the Nelson-Aalen estimate often do not
differ by much. The latter is considered more accurate in small samples
and also directly estimates the cumulative hazard. The
`"fleming-harrington"` method for `survfit()` reduces to Nelson-Aalen
when the data are unweighted. We can also estimate the cumulative hazard
as the negative log of the KM survival function estimate.

### Application to `bmt` dataset

```{r}

na_fit = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ group,
  type = "fleming-harrington",
  data = bmt)

km_fit = survfit(
  formula = surv ~ group,
  type = "kaplan-meier",
  data = bmt)

km_and_na = 
  bind_rows(
    .id = "model",
    "Kaplan-Meier" = km_fit |> fortify(surv.connect = TRUE),
    "Nelson-Aalen" = na_fit |> fortify(surv.connect = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  as_tibble()

```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen Survival Function Estimates, stratified by disease group"

km_and_na |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = surv, col = model)) +
  geom_step() +
  facet_grid(. ~ strata) +
  theme_bw() + 
  ylab("S(t) = P(T>=t)") +
  xlab("Survival time (t, days)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

```

The Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen survival estimates are very similar
for this dataset.
